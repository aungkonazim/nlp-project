what about him
what makes you think he will do it
forget his reputation  do you think we have got a plan or not

what would you do to her
she hates you with the fire of a thousand suns   that is a direct quote

two legs nice rack
yeah whatever  i want you to go out with her
sure sparky  i will get right on it
you just said
you need money to take a girl out
you got it verona  i pick up the tab you do the honors
i cannot take a girl like that out on twenty bucks
take it or leave it  this is not a negotiation
when i shell out fifty i expect results
i am on it
watching the bitch trash my car does not count as a date
a hundred bucks a date
forget it
it is about time
how would you do it
do what
i do not know dorsey the limothe flowers  another hundred for the tux 
are you lost

i hear you are helping verona
uh  yeah  we are old friend*
you and verona
you better not fuck this up  i am heavily invested
who's that
patrick verona   random skid
that is pat verona the one who was gone for a year i heard he was doing porn movies
i am sure he is completely incapable of doing anything that interesting
he always look so
mandella eat  starving yourself is a very slow way to die
that is this
the people at this school are so incredibly foul
william would never have gone to a state school
william did not even go to high school
that is never been proven
i appreciate your efforts toward a speedy death but i am consuming  do you mind
does it matter
you think this will work
what would he say
you went to the party  i thought we were officially opposed to suburban social activity
i did not have a choice
you did not have a choice  where is kat and what have you done with her
i did bianca a favor and it backfired
you did not
can you even imagine  who the hell would go to this a bastion of commercial excess
well i guess we are not since we do not have dates 
listen to you  you sound like betty all pissed off because archie is taking veronica
okay okay we will not go  it is not like i have a dress anyway
you ' re looking at this from the wrong perspective  we are making a statement
william  he asked me to meet him here
i mean woman  how ya doing
sweating like a pig actually  and yourself
there's a way to get a guy's attention
pick you up friday then
the night i take you to places you have never been before  and back
like where  the 7eleven on burnside do you even know my name screwboy
you hate me do not you
i do not really think you warrant that strong an emotion
then say you will spend dollar night at the track with me
and why would i do that
come on  the ponies the flat beer you with money in your eyes me with my hand on your ass
are you following me
you are not a big talker are you
excuse me
that is what you want is not it
you know these guys are no bikini kill or the raincoats but they are right up there
you know who the raincoats are
that is this
i am getting trashed man is not that what you are supposed to do at a party
i say do what you wanna do
you are not okay
i just need to lie down for awhile
uh uh you lie down and you will go to sleep
this is so patronizing
leave it to you to use big words when you are shitfaced
why  are you doing this
i told you
you do not care if i die
because then i would have to start taking out girls who like me
like you could find one
see that  who needs affection when i have got blind hatred
i thought you were above all that
and i am in control of it
no you were not
then why would you ask
i should do this
start a band
my father would not approve of that that
oh so now you think you know me
so what ' s up with your dad  he a pain in the ass
excuse me have you seen the feminine mystique  i lost my copy
what are you doing here
i heard there was a poetry reading
unwelcome  i guess someone still has her panties in a twist
do not for one minute think that you had any effect whatsoever on my panties
so what did i have an effect on 
he left  i sprung the dickhead and he cruised on me
i guess i never told you i am afraid of heights
c'mon  it is not that bad
put your right foot there 
forget it  i am staying
the partridge family
i figured it had to be something ridiculous to win your respect  and piss you off
good call
so how would you get chapin to look the other way
a soft side who knew
yeah well do not let it get out
so that is your excuse
so if you disappoint them from the start you are covered
something like that
tell me something true
i hate peas
no  something real  something no one else knows
no one else knows
you are amazingly selfassured has anyone ever told you that
is that a request or a command
no what
no i will not go with you
why not
create a little drama  start a new rumor  what
so i have to have a motive to be with you
you tell me
you need therapy  has anyone ever told you that
answer the question patrick
how would you get a tux at the last minute
it is scurvy's  his date got convicted where would you get the dress
it is just something i had  you know
oh huh
that ' s completely adorable
wait i
you were paid to take me out  by  the one person i truly hate  i knew it was a setup
it was not like that
really  what was it like  a down payment now then a bonus for sleeping with me
a fender strat you bought this
besides i had some extra cash some asshole paid me to take out a really great girl
is that right
why is my veggie burger the only burnt object on this grill
because i like to torture you
oh bianca  can you get me my freshman yearbook
i know
i thought we decided you were going to school here  at u of 0
my insurance does not cover pms
then tell them i had a seizure
is this about sarah lawrence you punishing me
i thought you were punishing me
why cannot we agree on this
because you are making decisions for me
as a parent that is my right
was that your sister
i do not understand the allure of dehydrated food  is this something i should be hip to
no daddy
so tell me about this dance was it fun
parts of it
which parts
the part where bianca beat the hell out of some guy
bianca did what
that is the matter  upset that i rubbed off on her
when i go
katarina stratford  my my  you have been terrorizing ms blaise again
i still maintain that he kicked himself in the balls  i was merely a spectator
am i supposed to feel better like right now  or do i have some time to think about it
cool pictures  you a fan
you think
what plan
the situation is my man cameron here has a major jones for bianca stratford
i think i speak correctly when i say that camerongs love is pure  purer than say  joey dorsey's
that is where we can help you  with kat
you two are gonna help me tame the wild beast
are you telling me i am a   nonsmoker
i prefer to think of it simply as an alternative to what the law allows
so you got cozy with she who stings
you were right she is still pissed
sweet love renew thy force
i missed you
it says here you exposed yourself to a group of freshmen girls
it was a bratwurst  i was eating lunch
i do not understand patrick  you have not done anything asinine this week are you not feeling well
touch of the flu

unfortunately don colon that is precisely where our opinions differ  are you familiar with the work of aristotle  erathostene  ptolemeus
your life and that of others

the state has some reason to be interested in this mangs proposition your eminence
it will not be easy to get rid of your prophet now don sanchez

space stattion 5  lounge
hi frank coming in please
dave if you have a minute i would like your advice on something
sure what is it
well it is nothing really important but it is annoying
that is up
it is possible
well what do you think we ought to do about it
i do not think we should make any fuss about it yet i am sure they will straighten it out
i must say i never did understand why they split us into two groups for training
i suppose the idea was specialized training
yes you must have heard the rumour that went around during orbital checkout
i do not know all i heard is that there's something about the mission we were not told
that seems very unlikely
yes i thought so
just ask hal it is conceivable they might keep something from us but they would never keep anything from hal
yes but it is to fantastic to think that they would keep something from us
i know it would be almost inconceivable
but not completely inconceivable
i suppose it is not logically impossible
i guess it is not
well that is something
yes i do not know what to make of it
i suppose computers have been known to be wrong
yes but it is more likely that the tolerances on our testing gear are too low
good morning how is it going
are you reasonably awake
oh i am fine i am wide awake that is up
well hal's reported the aounit about to fail again
i do not know hal said he thought it might be the assembly procedure
two units in four days how many spares do we have
two more
i did not do that frank i took particular care not to freeze them
i guess you do not know your own strength old boy
i guess not
sorry to interrupt the festivities dave but i think we have got a problem
what is it hal
the unit is still operational dave but it will fail within seventytwo hours
not now hal i would like to talk to you about something
sure dave that is up
you know that we checked the two aounits that you reported in imminent failure condition
yes i know
you probably also know that we found them okay
i am not questioning your word dave but it is just not possible i am not capable of being wrong
i am sorry about the misunderstanding hal
well do not worry about it
and do not you worry about it
is your confidence in me fully restored
yes it is hal
too bad about frank is not it
yes it is
the antenna has to be replaced
i am goin to do this myself hal let me have the control please
look dave your have probably got a lot to do i suggest you leave it to me
i am at space station five darling how are you
i am having a party tomorrow
yes i know that sweetheart
are you coming to my party
no i am sorry darling i told you i will not be home for a few days
when are you coming home

thank you daddy
i will wish you a happy birthday now and i will see you soon all right darling
yes daddy
'bye 'bye now sweetheart
oh thank you very much
thank you
well i have heard more and more people talk of an epidemic
i suppose it was bound to happen sooner or later
i was working out what this trip must cost taking him up there by himself and coming back empty
and your charming little daughter
oh she is growing up very fast as a matter of fact she is six tomorrow
oh that is such a delightful age
clavius control came on the air just long enough to transmit their refusal
are you sure you will not change your mind about a drink
no thank you and i am afraid now i really must be going
well gregor and i will look forward to seeing you
well thank you very much for being so understanding
please it really does not matter
well did you have a pleaant flight
yes very pleasant
yes i think so just about then
i suppose you saw the work on our new section while you were docking
are you quite sure
well as it happens i am on my way up to the moon
are you by any chance going up to your base at clavius
i am sorry but i am not sure i know what you mean
you mean you have not been able to get anyone at the base for ten days
that is right
yes well i hope the crew got back safely
fortunately they did
this epidemic could easily spread to our base dr floyd we should be given all the facts
yes it does the subsurface structure shows that it was deliberately buried about four million years ago
how can you tell it was deliberately buried
by the deformation between the mother rock and the fill
but you do not have any idea as to what it is
has it been exposed to any sun before now
oh marvellous it is the first real sleep i have had for the past two days
there's nothing like weightless sleep for a complete rest
when do we arrive at clavius
we are scheduled to dock in about seven hours is there anything we can do for you
thank you
incidentally dr floyd i wonder if i can have a word with you about the security arrangements
i see
well fine thanks very much anyway and i hope you do not mind me asking
right hal tell me whether the following statements are true or false
i will if i can frank
our transit time is 257 days is that true
that is true
five by five frank
hal i am going out now to replace the ao unit
i understand
pod bay is decompressed all doors are secure you are free to open pod bay doors
yes hal that is up
i know you did frank but i assure you there was an impending failure
do you have any idea of what is causing this fault
not really frank i think there may be a flaw in the assembly procedure
this is three years old
we do not wash 'em ya know
maybe you better have a black russian

personally they are of no interest to me i would rather sell weaponsbut i have a customer so tell me
even it i did know where the stones were i would never tell somebody like you
why  that is wrong with me
i am a priest i am here to serve life all you want to do is destroy it

your theory is interesting father but i do not think we have time to go into it right now

but what happens if instead of this ultimate warrior it is evil who stands here
what are we going to do
it is a miracle

his passing has left me with something of a dilemma  a terrible terrible dilemma
do you carry a gun mr welles
i wear a gun when i can tell a client expects me to  other than that there's never any reason
do you want to tell me what you found
it is a film of a girl being murdered
will you watch it and see for yourself
you you need to go to the police
i told you i cannot not yet
i deal in divorce cases  corporate investigations
you have found missing persons before
my husband never dealt with money personally certainly not cash
i am not positive this means anything
okay i follow you so far
totalled together these five checks from five different accounts they equal one million dollars
you are joking
i am here
you told me to look so i looked
mrs christian tom welles here
how are you  having any luck
i do not know if luck's the word are you feeling alright
i have been ordered into bed  the doctor says i have gotten the flu or some other wretched ailment
i hope it is nothing serious
i have got about five thousand left in cash but i will need another thirty if you approve
how will i get it to you
what was the name  i have got it here somewhere
neil neil cole
they hired you  you are like a private detective
what was she running from
i do not know
september 4th 1993  about a year after mary disappeared
we were divorced by then  things fell apart he was living with a friend
why do you think he did it
i had to ask  i apologize
people remember me from the news  can you drive me back now
we are all like that
there was not one  the police looked
do you think the police did a good job
how how can you say that to me

it was just an accident  like with dan
you had me scared on the phone  that is wrong with the baby

i really think you need to calm down now okay
krueger is reality
lookwe are all tired  none of us had any sleep since friday night
are you alright
you think that is the place she is buried
you do good work alice
he sure loves to stay awake
give up mark it is hopeless
not to mention the heartbreak of psoriasis
my dad's got this thing about drinking in the house
i have got to write some of this down
mark are you okay
i want to talk to both you guys about greta  and
i thought about that
do you think i am an idiotfor being in love with her
tell me some more about this krueger guy
who's jacob
my baby
whoa slow down  how are you gonna hide from a guy like that leave the planet
where are you going
i could not do that mark  he is my last link with danno i want him
they think i am nuts
they could not prove it  no body  nuns bumping themselves off is bad for business
but i have seen her grave
poor woman
i do not understand
yeah when are you gonna come to your senses

bottom line alice  anybody supernatural or not that wants to hurt you  he will have to go through us first
dan  and he is taking alice with him  pretty good dive yvonne  you have been practicing
it is okay
you too
i should have suspectcd when i heard that  wouldoctor'  i thought it was your father
it was supposed to be  dad had a heart attack two days ago
how is he  
it was moderate  he will be all right  but it was out of the question his coming along
what is it
your 'out'  this came for you 
my father  he is not  
we are uallu risking our lives
that may be  but dad stays where uheu is and i am staying here
unidentified flying objects
maybe  just 'maybe'  when their ship does not return  they will decide not to come here after all
but if they udou
but julie's a nice girl and i have seen you work  she deserves a fighting chance
uthat isu the worst possible moment
what could be worse than disappoint ing a little girl
i guess skipper neilsen re tired before you enrolled at the academy did not he
have you ever talked to carl  tried to see his side
we are stuck tight
you all wait here  i am going inside take a look
i think you are right
hey  you know something  it is getting lighter in here
and if i did not uknowu better  i would swear we were moving
you hear that
where do you think the voice you heard was coming from
somewhere down there
wonder where powell and carney are
here  keep these  it wants me to come alone
get ready  we shove off as soon as griff reports all the crew aboard
is there any way out of it
seems to be all around
what about down
course and speed
what course skipper
you better take powell and carney with you 
the frogmen
with their underwater experience they will be invaluable  take sidearms and flare pistols 
sidearms  but the saucer's dead
excuse me skipper
yes griff
skipper  could you take a look here
something wrong
the inertial navigation system must have been knocked out in the crash
why do you say that
now they feel itdown below
it does not seem possible but  could it be an electrical storm center  
under uwateru
above murmansk and finland
suppose our theorizing is correct then this ucouldu be the next danger point
in such a way as to prevent his returning to it and as you put it   arecharging his batteries'
the radiation level  from the saucer  it is rising
as we near the pole
there's got to be an explanation
all ready
i am  afraid i have some bad news for you reef   you will have to share quarters this trip
who with
what do you think
determine extent of damage immediately
you are sure it is cyclops
that is the running time
right uatu him
that is what i said
but  what can we accomplish
straight to the pole  at almost fifty knots
that is the corrected bearing to the magnetic pole
remove your weapons commander and come here  alone
that is a ufaceu
point of view is everything to us uyouru form of life is ugly as we appear to you
my mission is to study various solar systems and planets  select the most suitable for colonization 
he did
why not me  what am i  the closing act
it is a living thing  when damaged  you would say 'wounded'  it immediately 'heals' itself
that is why no water leaked inside when we rammed you
my yeoman will show you to your quarters
well i will be  
you plotted the course of cyclops  then that is uouru course  wherever uheu goes uweu gountil we get him
we have asked ourselves that  over and over  a thousand times
due north  at five knotsno six
cyclops will have to linger at the pole to recharge his power banks
you got yourself a computer alma
been putting my files into it you take sugar and milk
alma i think there's some dirty business going on in this town

jack's sort of sensitive i guess more than most but he will be okay in a few weeks
jack does not need money
everybody needs money except guys like twombley and that sonofabitch soninlaw of his people like that
i can see what you looked like as a kid
what way
after making love i like it it is nice to see that in a grownup person
oh wade
i have been thinking about it that is all
did you tell them  that we were coming
do not you think it is proper for a fella to introduce his girl to his parents
i know your parents
are you sure they are home did you call
think they are alright
what happened
what on earth is happening to you why are you acting this way
it is my tooth my fucking tooth i cannot even think anymore because of it
do not lie to me you are leaving me i can see that
have you been heating the house not just with the stove
there's a furnace
you are not using it today
it is broke i guess there's an electric in the bedroom
coffee's perked
when did she die
whitehouse next time phone ahead
what the hell are you talking about
yesterday morning you passed a stopped school bus which was flashing its lights then you
hold on
do not give me a hard time mr gordon i am just 
doing your fucking job i know i watch television too
who are you
i was i am wade whitehouse i was wondering is your husband here
he is asleep we were up very late
well yes i am i want to say that i am real sorry about your father mrs twombley
something about my father
oh no no it is a it is a traffic thing no big deal
take care wade
i am not finding fault it is a good idea good for you good for the town real modern too
you talked to jack
not since last night he took a guy hunting
the other guy
jillie you want a cheese grilled sandwich
his office you mean my old office
well i guess  that is what he said
you remember margie fogg
from wickham's been a while like some coffee
how you and ma doing have not seen you in town for a while
where is ma
is there something wrong with the phone
in the living room
why did not you call and have the furnace fixed
pop for christ's sake
love what the fuck do you know about love
love i am made of love
call it what you want
nothing in the fucking house to drink not a fucking thing my house my money my truck  stolen
it will come out jack lied and the kid will get hung for it
no shit
you think jack shot him
well it was an accident
the night before the shooting
how was she
jill i was thinking of getting a lawyer maybe you can help me
what happened
do not think about it you are exhausted
yeah i guess
have not you already done a bit of that
pointless to stand around in church with nothing to do i guess
anyone else want one rolfe
no thanks i do not drink
what about margie
what about her
anything new about the shooting twombley
i guess it was an accident like everybody thinks
find them everywhere 
i think your first response to the twombley shooting was the correct one
which is
that it was not an accident
then who shot him
well your friend i think jack hewitt
who would pay him that kind of money not the mob they got their own guys specialists
they would not deal with a guy like jack who else benefits if twombley is suddenly dead
so mel gordon would not want a professional hit that would make the feds dig deeper he wants an accident
not particularly
right's right goddamnit do not you care that is right
i hate to disappoint you but i do not think it happened
of course it happened why would i lie about it
it may have happened but not the way you said
we would have to go digging in vietnam to ask him
and elbourne and mom took you to the doctor and told him you fell from the hay loft
i know what it means i am just running out of ways to use it
it is not like he has not made us wait a few times
well you are not the president dear
you do not want to say hi to your father
i am sure he is busy
mom just this once give it a rest
you are jetlagged  we will talk about this back
he is in a meeting  he cannot be disturbed

some southern plantation owner falls in love with this poor
kruger sagittarius
did you feel that
yes i did

yes it did  mr dunn can i ask you a personal question
what is it mary
shut down accelerators
we seem to have a malfunction in disposal unit four sir
sir i have got an overload in disposal unit four
it is got to be stopped
but ted the invitations have already gone out
ted that is wrong
ted you are overworked  you have been flying yourself into the ground
eat this spaghetti ted  it will make you feel a lot better
who's that ted
elaine when are you going to realize simon kurtz put me in here to get me out of the way
no goodbyes elaine  just go
if that is the way you want it
that is the way i want it  just turn the radio on and go
ted  what are you
ted we are taking off
what are you doing ted
elaine we have to go back
ted get a grip on yourself  you should never have left the hospital
then you udou think i am insane
i have never used the word insane ted
what word would you use elaine
the word is sick  ted  very very very sick
what would you say if i told you the toilet just blew up in my face
elaine that is going on
ted we have only got ten minutes
not now elaine
well elaine this might be it if those guys on the ground do not think of something
i just want you to know i love you ted and always will
simon just ejected
sit down elaine  if this bomb trick works we just might make it  simon was a fool to eject now
you mean
that is right  premature ejection
are you afraid
not when i am with you ted

let's talk hubley
his body was discovered three days ago in an alley off of central avenue near downtown
with two bri sabot slugs in the chest
through the chest  rupturing both the primary and secondary hearts
terrific  a real pillar of the community  was hubley missing anything when they found him  was he ripped off
yes no it is not unreasonable although i
get the picture
and that fits
well yeah it is rubber  it stretches
newcomers working near methane gasses at oil refineries must paint it on their boots to protect against sparks

money money
you are mad she is mad wolfi
i see that you are expecting
oh yes
when may i ask
what is ridiculous wolfi has many admirers in vienna they love him here people send us gifts all the time
but you cannot take her without reference it is unheard of
and so you do the only time you come out is to eat
and what do you expect who wants to walk out into a mess like this every day
oh now i am a bad housekeeper
so you are the place is a pigsty all the time
be careful
let us pass please let us pass at once we are with the emperor
i am sorry madame it is not permitted
do you know who i am  this is my daughter i am frau weber we are favoured guests
i am sorry madame but i have my orders
i am sorry madame but no i cannot let anyone pass
it is such an honour for us to have you here herr mozart and for gertrude
what a strange young man
perhaps a little refreshment first a little coffee or a little chocolate
just one year
who was your teacher
i was but she quite outgrew the little i could show her
what a charming idea may i see
it is just a trifle of course
delightful court composer would you permit me to play it as he comes in
you do me too much honour sire
and here is our illustrious court composer herr salieri
well i am glad to hear that
excuse me sire but what do you think these could be being a foreigner i would love to learn
good morning court composer this is my niece the princess elizabeth
oh your majesty it would be such a tremendous honour
you already commissioned an opera from mozart
and the result satisfies
yes of course my concern is to protect you from any suspicion of favouritism
i do not think you understand me court composer
majesty i did believe me it was a most agonizing decision but finally i simply could not recommend herr mozart
majesty i do not like to talk against a fellow musician
of course not
do you like this salieri
it is not a question of liking your majesty your own law decrees it i am afraid
oh thank you
the director of our opera count orsinirosenberg
and now he has returned the compliment herr salieri composed that march of welcome for you
why so
well what is it about tell us the story
yes where
keep it sire if you want to it is already here in my head
what on one hearing only
it is new it is is not it sire
yes indeed
and german
oh yes absolutely german unquestionably
what do you mean sire
majesty this is madame weber she is my landlady
really how delightful may i ask when you marry
bravo mozart most charming yes indeed clever man
majesty may i ask you to do me the greatest favour
mozart are you aware i have declared the french play of figaro unsuitable for our theatre
yes sire
yet we hear you are making an opera from it is this true
who told you this majesty
it is not your place to ask questions is it true
well yes i admit it is
would you tell me why
but majesty this is just a frolic it is a piece about love
i have no idea
guess guess majesty imagine the longest time such a thing could last then double it
well six or seven minutes maybe eight
forgive me majesty i am a vulgar man but i assure you my music is not
you are passionate mozart but you do not persuade
ahha what do you say chamberlain
yes sir
well what do you have for me today
your majesty herr mozart 
yes what about him
he is here
why are you here
am i not welcome
is she not here
do not you have a maid
oh we could if we wanted to but stanzi will not hear of it she wants to do everything herself
how is your financial situation
it could not be better
that is not what i hear
what do you mean it is wonderful really it is  it is marvelous people love me here
they say you are in debt
who who says that now that is a malicious lie
composition does not pay you know that
that is that
oh let's not talk about it
why not
it is a secret
you do not have secrets from me
is not that marvelous we are delighted
why did not you mention it in your letters

look i must have pupils without pupils i cannot manage
you do not mean to tell me you are living in poverty
no but i am broke i am always broke i do not know why
it has been said my friend that you are inclined to live somewhat above your means
how can anyone say that we have no cook no maid we have no footman nothing at all
of course not
do you have a daughter
ah how exciting tell me more
i would better not it is a bit of a secret
come come mozart i am interested truly
actually it is a big secret oh this is delicious what is it
cream cheese mixed with granulated sugar and suffused with rum crema al mascarpone
ah italian
forgive me we all have patriotic feelings of some kind
two thousand two hundred florins is all i need a hundred fifty
what exactly are you working on
wolfgang what is it sta calmo per favore that is the matter
it is unbelievable the director has actually ripped out a huge section of my music pages of it
you burned the score
oh no my wife took it out in time
how fortunate
it is not fair that a man like that has power over our work
but there are those who have power over him i think i will take this up with the emperor
oh excellency would you
with all my heart mozart
what did you think of it yourself did you like it at all
i think it is marvelous truly
oh no the honour would be all mine
grazie mio caro wolfgang
mozart it was good of you to come
how could i not
did my work please you
i never knew that music like that was possible
you flatter me
i have come to commission work from you
what work
a mass for the dead
what dead who is dead
a man who deserved a requiem mass and never got one
who are you
i am only a messenger do you accept you will be paid well
how long will you give me
i do not have it yet it is not finished i am sorry but i need more time
are you neglecting my request
what happened is it over
i am taking you home you are not well
where is your wife
not here she is not well either she went to the spa
you mean she is not coming back
you are so good to me truly thank you
no please
i would never miss anything that you had written you must know that
do you mean that
i do
i have bad fancies i do not sleep well anymore then i drink too much and think stupid things
are you ill
shall i answer it
the man he is here
finish what
another but that is too soon tomorrow night it is impossible did he say a hundred
yes can i  could i help you in any way
would you actually you could
my dear friend it would be my greatest pleasure
but you would have to swear not to tell a soul i am not allowed
then let us try together i would regard it as such an honour tell me what is this work
where did i stop
the end of the recordare  statuens in parte dextra
so now the confutatis confutatis maledictis when the wicked are confounded flammis acribus addictis how would you translate that
consigned to flames of woe
a fire which never dies burning one forever
confutatis maledictis
the fire
what time
i think so
it could not be simpler
first bassoon and tenor trombone  what
with the tenors
also identical
and that is all
do you have me
i think so
c major sopranos and altos in thirds altos on c sopranos above  voca voca me voca me cum bene dictis
sopranos up to f on the second 'voca'
and that is it do you have it
you go fast
do you want to rest a bit
oh no i am not tired at all
we will stop for just a moment then we will do the lacrimosa
i can keep going i assure you shall we try
would you stay with me while i sleep a little
i am not leaving you
i am so ashamed
what for
then why especially does it have to be in german
what you think mozart is scarcely the point it is what his majesty thinks that counts
that will do herr mozart
mozart herr mozart may i have a word with you please right away
did you not know that his majesty has expressly forbidden ballet in his operas
yes but this is not a ballet this is a dance at figaro's wedding
exactly a dance
but surely the emperor did not mean to prohibit dancing when it is part of the story
what are you doing herr director
can we see the scene with the music back please
what is this herr chamberlain
what is what
why do i have to submit samples of my work to some stupid committee just to teach a sixteenyearold girl
because his majesty wishes it
is the emperor angry with me
on the contrary
then why does not he simply appoint me to the post
mozart you are not the only composer in vienna
no but i am the best
a little modesty would suit you better
who is on this committee
kapellmeister bonno count orsini rosenberg and court composer salieri
herr mozart 
i do not think it was really decided director
what do you want
i am father vogler i am a chaplain here i thought you might like to talk to someone
about what
in the sight of god that is a sin
what do you want
do you understand that you have sinned gravely
leave me alone
i cannot leave alone a soul in pain
do you know who i am you never heard of me did you
that makes no difference all men are equal in god's eyes
are they
offer me your confession i can offer you god's forgiveness
how well are you trained in music
here in vienna
oh i know that that is charming  i did not know you wrote that
i did not that was mozart wolfgang amadeus mozart you know who that is
of course the man you accuse yourself of killing
ah  you have heard that
all vienna has heard that
and do they believe it
is it true
do you believe it
do you hear me
did you try
you cannot say that
my son no one can speak for god
oh i thought you did so every day so speak now answer me
why why why why add to your misery by confessing to murder you did not kill him
i did
no you did not
i poisoned his life
but not his body
what difference does that make
are you absolutely sure
what anger
about the ballet
ballet what ballet
excuse me  did not his majesty specifically forbid ballet in his opera
yes absolutely is there a ballet in figaro
bravo your majesty
well actually sire if you remember we did finally incline to italian
i know we banned this play but frankly i cannot remember why can you refresh my memory herr director
for the same reason herr chamberlain that it was banned in france
here i am my angel
what who the devil are you
i have taken pity on you my angel i heard your wish
i cannot wait
well promise then
what do you mean  now
excuse me sir there is a lady who insists on talking to you
who is she
she did not say but she says it is urgent
that lady is back sir
herr salieri

what time is it
miss price the other nurse that attended you
do you have bad dreams too
some everyone does
hello david i am dr hirsch and this is a countryman of yours mr collins
where am i
you are in a hospital in london
london where is jack i had a strange dream
i should think so after your recent traumatic experiences
the guy i was with is he all right how did i get to london
miss price miss price please
how long have i been here
you have been unconscious since you were brought in two weeks ago
there were witnesses
in time i am sure it will all come back to you
you have never had bad dreams before
you would be surprised what horrors a man is capable of
did you see jack
no in fact your wounds were cleaned and dressed before you arrived here
did you talk to the police in east proctor did the cops go to the slaughtered lamb
dr hirsch  i would rather not be by myself
you are not having a good time are you
well i like it here
do you think she will meet me in rome
i think debbie klein is a mediocre person with a good body
debbie is not mediocre and she has one of the great bodies of all time
she is a jerk
you are talking about the woman i love
i am talking about a girl you want to fuck so give me a break
well anyway do you think she will be there
if you do not stop i am going to kill you
i have to make love to her it is very simple she has no choice really
it just fascinates me that you can spend so much energy on someone so dull
it is impossible for a body like that to be dull
we have known debbie what since the eighth grade how many years of foreplay is that
the slaughtered lamb
of course the slaughtered lamb why else would they have a severed fox head on a spear as their symbol
that is a wolf's head
of course the slaughtered lamb why else would they have a severed wolf's head on a spear as their symbol
that is not a spear it is a pike
nice looking group
listen at least it is warm in here
what about it
it is a fivepointed star
ask them what the candles are for
go on ask them
jack we would better go
come on jack shall we go
what the hell was that all about
i do not know let's see if there's an inn or something up the road
beware the moon
what do you think was wrong
i have no idea
maybe that pentangle was for something supernatural
say david
did you hear that
i heard that
a coyote
there are not any coyotes in england
the hound of the baskervilles
heathcliffe did not howl
no but he was on the moors
shit david what is that
i do not know come on
come on where
it is moving
it is in front of us
oh shit what is that
nice doggie good boy
walk away jack
it sounds far away
where are we going
i will tell you when we get there
you really scared me you shithead
nice to see you
get the fuck out of here jack
thanks a lot
this is too much i cannot handle this
i am sorry to be upsetting you david but i had to come
are not you supposed to be buried in new york someplace
yeah your parents came to my funeral i was surprised at how many people came
why should you be surprised you were a very wellliked person
debbie klein cried a lot
i cannot stand it
so you know what she does she is so grief stricken she runs to find solace in rudy levine's bed
rudy levine the shmuck
david now i know this may be hard for you but i have to warn you
we were attacked by a werewolf
i am not listening
on the moors we were attacked by a lycanthrope a werewolf
shut up you zombie
i was murdered an unnatural death and now i walk the earth in limbo until the werewolf's curse is lifted
that is wrong with you shut up
the wolf's bloodline must be severed the last remaining werewolf must be destroyed
you survived and now you shall continue the curse
what are you talking about i will not accept this get out god damit
remember what that guy at the slaughtered lamb said 'beware the moon'
stop it jack
beware the moon the full moon david you have got two days
jack please go away please go away
you will stalk the streets of london a creature of the night
you are talking like boris karloff it is movie dialogue
the supernatural the powers of darkness it is all true take your own life suicide david join me
you are not real
what are you doing here
i wanted to see you
okay you have seen me now go away
david i am sorry i upset you yesterday but you must understand what is going on

a monster i know i know
you must take your own life now david before it is too late
jack are you really dead
you must believe me
hi jack
what can i say jack
you do not have to say anything
are not you going to say 'i told you so'
if i was still alive i probably would
you look awful
because this must be stopped
i could hang myself
dr hirsch
no thank you doctor
you were saying
has david kessler anything to say concerning the attack on the moors
the forensic lads seem to feel that some sort of animal was involved that is true but i hardly think
what can we do to assist you
lt villiers and sgt mcmanus are here to see you doctor
excuse me  yes
roger mathison doctor

your ma would not let us leave until we ate something
here's liberty's favorite son  i will never forget what you did cousin
our place clell miller's sammy johnston the creeders will hite
the sheriff says it was a gang of drunk kansas boys
these are deeds and mortgages of farms the bank was holding for the railroad
uhh yeah it does
we got a problem here brother
this is the best score yet
it is still taking too long the people used to snap to
that was because of the reputation the gang had
as long as people think jesse's still riding we will never get the respect we deserve
cole we are outlaws not exactly the most respectable job if you know what i mean
how would they 
what have you done
i ai not done 
i swear 
i am sorry cole
things changed when you quit the gang for example i am now the one who says let's ride
he is not bad at it
my plan of lying here pissing myself seems to be working mighty fine thank you
jesus mercy that is charlie higgins dave laller 
cole i want to get to the farm make sure little jim and the girls are okay
oh no
they said because the detectives were working for the department of the interior 
you have no shame
okay folks i think we know how this is going to go
beg pardon
this is about the wanted posters is not it
the things a fella has to do to get a little respect around here
you are a fine figure of a man
listen jesse we have got a problem  it is cole
he is been full of vinegar lately
listen he is my brother and i do not want to start trouble
what you saying boy
about time you got here buddy
ride with me cousin
i could use the walk
where you boys going
home boys back to our farms
hands off your hip cole
you are not scared are you

you ever notice zerelda's eyes
she had a moustache
she was european
thanks for the help
after all you did on our farm  you miss it do not you jesse
the war what are you crazy  there are things i miss about it
it was exciting
so what do we do general lee
perfect cole
i got seven thousand
see frank's being smart about this
jesse we got to have a word
sure cousin
this is your fault for hogging all the publicity
it will be the biggest score yet
smells funny it being mentioned in the paper
if you would read about it first you would have no problems
now the one time one of us comes up with an idea 
a bad idea
i got us through the war all right
and almost got hanged in peacetime
i am the better soldier jesse
still smells fishy
okay you are gonna rest here
bob rip up some bandages
we will make them pay for this
i am out
what we follow you for a year and now that our blood's been spilled you are gonna quit

you know you getting caught right after leaving us some people thought 
where would you get all these riders
some indian tracker you turned out to be tom
cannon or gatling
both would be nice

i think one of 'em's glass
which one right or left
oh lord the dance hall girl at bunty's

on account of we are robbing it
oh why did not you just say so
it is a secret
fine i will just wait here

what is it
where the hell were you
 rode right into them screaming like a banshee
my little web did that
web died fighting
what do you say sir
he is going to be fine right daddy
they are gone what are you 
i fooled them into thinking i was alone
well i hope the boy pulls through we should know in the morning
every time i put my head up to hit that gatling they try to shoot it off
distracting enough for you
pff they hardly even noticed you
such as
you could have worn one of those big floppy womangs easter sunday hats
that would have made an impression
i figure
see that is your problem frank by the time you finish figuring out stuff i am already finished doing it
web's dead
i reckoned
hell of a war
looks like web mimms was not the only casualty this towngs got
frank do not you have something to say
you are doing just fine
think about this if we just come up with a story and stick to it we should be all right
that just might work
big and older
you can shut up now
you are a charmer
i swear i will shoot you in your sleep
she is still talking to jesus
you know him
you ready to stop loafing around with this young lady and get back to farming
you are looking a bit more spry now that somebody 
 we could move on rebuild make a decent life someplace else
do not care
did not think you would  i am going to go make the coffin
how would it go in there
fine how would it go out here
and i planned getting you off the hangmangs deck 
and it is guarded by pinkerton detectives
gents we are in the middle of something here
bob's upset
pardon the delay folks but we had to get mad bob younger under control
this has been a good year
jesse we are outlaws
and we are good at it
it got to you did not it all the killing in the war you need it now
you have killed your fair share of men
if i could go back to farming 
that is a lie you could have bought a dozen farms with the money we have stolen
i cannot quit and leave you alone i cannot quit until you quit ma would have wanted it that way
we are doing this for ma
we are drunk
oh yeah
you taking sides against me now frank
they are all pinned down cannot even get to the door
shoulda learned with web made it look fun made it look like an adventure got web killed now jim
railroad burned him out too you could not have stopped him
a war against the railroad what the hell were we thinking
i will meet you down there in a few weeks
see you soon oh and i appreciate the distraction back there
y'know uncle frank
sounds like he was a hell of a man
that he was
they are making him a hero now
saved a lot of folk from the railroad
but he killed a lot of men too
cannot argue that
so what was he
uncle frank
yeah jimmy
how much of that story is true
did you kill yankees
a fair number ma
ma i am glad to see you being nice to our injun friend
the lord says we can bury 'em out back in the orchard nobody will ever find them
we know ma now we got to get you to doc mimms
zerelda little zee mimms
you were little jesse james when you left
but still died
you should not be up
i have been on my back two weeks i am sick of it
you are sick of my company
no i mean of course not no
teasing you is completely unfair
what you do to me is unfair the teasing i mean
i was not the only one risking my neck that day
so you are saying i should leave you alone and go spend time with jimmy younger
you did not want to farm
i was thinking more along the lines of being a river pirate
a river pirate
arr hand over your jewels missy
thank god you grew out of that  you did grow out of that did not you
mostly it would be an all right life for a bachelor
you planning on being a bachelor your whole life jesse james
not if i find the right girl
and that is this right girl like
smart funny bossy always makes me think she is two steps ahead of me and big buck teeth
where will you find such a girl
ahem from this doctrine no ah from womengs eyes this doctrine i derive they sparkle still like  shiny sparkling rocks
sparkling rocks
little ones
were you planning on kissing me when you finished quoting
i am so sorry jesse
you and i we have started something you know  i do not know what will happen if you do this
me neither
let the law 
laws do not touch men like thaddeus rains only justice does
whose justice yours or god's  when will you stop
jesse what are you thinking there are bounty hunters and lawmen all over this county
i do not understand
she is the most wonderful woman in the world cannot get her out of my mind
that is wonderful it is just i thought
i would never have imagined us in a place like this
that is why i picked it we can start a whole new life down here
i beg your pardon
blazing guns of the west true stories of jesse james only a dime in the hotel lobby
aw shucks ma'am
stop it this is just sad
you get arrested again i will kill you
yes ma'am
i cannot believe i had to blow up a train for you
you are a hell of a woman
do not swear
we are moving you tomorrow
so i will get a fair trial in front of a jury bought off by thaddeus rains
did you order our houses burned down
how did you spot the ambush in torrell
almost got me in billings i saw you there shooting at me
i went myself to oversee the operation did not help much
oh that is nice to know  we are going to hang you you know
i figured
was it worth it
should have just killed thaddeus rains and been done with it
that is what i would have done
i am not hanged yet
you cocky little bastard
ahh you will miss me
that was for my ma now this is for everybody else
i would just as soon kill you jesse james but chasing you takes up too much of my time
this is unusual most of our marriages are members of the congregation
discretion sir i am a man of the cloth
thank you
now let's have a drink
and you are too young
i am the same age you were when you went off to war
you okay jesse
yeah hey are you drinking whisky you are too young to be drinking whisky
not too young to shoot a man not to young to drink
jim you been with a girl yet
well not exactly
i swear
tell you something else  i cannot drink that good neither i am going to go outside and throw up
 too young for whisky
this time we will make an exception
jesse you explain to lyla my girl you know from that time
why yeah
i hope you do not mind jesse james told me your name
oh you were talking to jesse
i hope i am not being too forward
not at all
i just though you were awful cute
thank you miss  
lyla devereux
gosh that is a pretty name buy you a drink
could we go upstairs and talk it is so loud down here
why do not we get a bottle of sherry to sip while we talk
well this land is about to be condemned
my professional opinion is that you have managed to piss off the wrong bunch of farm boys this time
they had to be dealt with
there's only four of them
mr thaddeus rains sir it is a pleasure to have you join us in the field
leaving you in charge of operations until he recovers
yes sir
i see i will get together four patrols of our detectives for action tonight
how much did they get from the safe
thirtyfive thousand sir coins and currency and the delay from the miles of destroyed track 
i will kill them for blowing up my railway
to be precise they did not blow up the tracks
then who did
your men knew the risks
with my money
the final route for the railroad is complete
what is that
this is him
how did you know
look at this pinkerton they got the payroll and this damage will set construction back two months at least
you would not have done that
oh no i would have done that but i would have made sure i killed them too
i want them arrested and hanged
would a jury around here convict their own i think not we are beginning an interesting game here mr rains
this is no game
so you cannot tell me anything
i cannot believe this
yes that is the way to win the locals back to our side
cannot you tell me anything
in english pinkerton
there are only four banks within that travel radius which they have not robbed
can you put men at all four
no need i have another tool at my disposal which will narrow it down to one bank

they still have to give 'em refreshments laced with mindaltering drugs
you are a fanatic
alice you gotta make him do the startup with teddy and me
make him
i am just screwed
you know what he is like he just wants to work on stuff that is cool
you do not wanna move do you
it is important
if he is really a bully he will not cop to it anyway
did not you visit the campus
i forgot that is why you have to help me decide
no way you have this  destiny
c'mon i would not have a destiny without you my destiny would be dying at 20 from eating 
do not bring that up like a different girlfriend would would have let you die
whengs brian coming for the tv
that took some fun out of 
you know he is never been anybody's counselor before
to our new life  that is wrong
he is your boss he is not your 
i know i know
if you cannot deal with him on that basis you better get a new counselor
i mean if one little comment from gary is gonna upset you this much 
teddy was killed last night
what are you  what
are you saying you think they had something to do with his death nelson said it was an airtight case
i do not know what i am saying maybe  maybe they hired those guys
you are scaring me i think we should just go
go where you cannot get away from people like this
like this it is gary you are talking about
you think i do not know that
i cannot just walk away
i know how to get in there but you have gotta help me
whaddo i do
the justice department guy who came to the apartment when 
if i would stayed down there maybe this would not have happened
why does not he ask us to his party he is never even met you
he has thousands of employees milo 
are you gonna tell me where you went
you look beautiful
do not we have any chopsticks
wanna savor this
it is gonna get cold
right wait a toast
he will tell me when he gets home
that will be a test will not it
he was not acting
do not worry milo i am here as a friend or maybe a supplicant
it is just  i kind of feel the need to do something with my ability create something
mr barton do you remember me
it is  milo is not it
yes sir i need to talk to you
yeah hi thank you for seeing me
what seems to be the problem you look a little upset
my friend my best friend teddy was killed in silicon valley
if there's a civil rights violation but generally we let the local police and da do their work first
i  just wanna help bring these guys to justice they are neonazis
let me look into it see that is being done frankly it is not my area
'just did not know who else to talk to
and outpost you are happy there
well i parked illegally see y'later
this is the biggest beta demo in like the history of software you would be my partner
you cannot preempt yoga that is our biggest show
will i get to work for outpost
you are interfaced with our dish
is it your software
when did you know
that is gotta kill him right
outpost was his baby sure on the other hand we just learned gary boyd owns the skywire satellites personally
that would change with a criminal indictment
there's no hard evidence he knew about this anybody who could implicate him seems to have vanished
is not there a stigma bankrolling this guy
stigma larry 60 billion buys you some slack in this world
and the kid who wrote skywire  then gave it away they are calling him the digital robin hood
milo surprised he is not your guest
we tried
milo i am danny
'could not convince teddy to come
he is pretty tight with his family
we could move 'em up here
who's that
would you like a coke or something
you know a lot about art i guess
when you get to a certain age you start wondering about your legacy i doubt you even remember outpost 10 
no just waiting for my counselor to come by and introduce himself
'think i should buy some originals
do i
somebody said i am just another philistine with reproductions
that is insane you are ahead of your time
how is it going
maybe i am going too fast
it is okay really
you did this  overnight
milo that is up
well  you sent for me
you really wrote this just today
i heard what happened
had you talked to him much lately
just once 'guess i was worried we did not have anything to talk about since work was offlimits non disclosure
did you
talk about work never
i meant did you find other stuff to 
oh yeah
you have been coming in early
wow you must have 20000 lines of code there
been thinking about the push mechanism in the handler and it came over me it is in the wrong place
the wrong place
gary hi
you look a little tired
i am okay it is going well
that is great thanks
you could have handwritten it
i am not much good at handwriting or parties
gary i 
this is good who did it
'startup not 50 miles from here kid's on prozac
what would the girl say
has not affected his work though
help me change the skywire settings add five degrees to each satellite coordinate
gary do not worry we 
okay 2
ready for number three
let's go
longitude 109 
all the companies know the faculties tell 'em at the target schools
i think you should go
you do
it is only meaningful when you have got 40000 lines of code to back it up
man could he write code totally elegant he had his own style
your app kind of blew mine out of the water
we will come up with the next big thing
you wanna work  here
could it be a glitch something the construction workers caused
every entry was authorized
keep looking
what are we looking for
delbert seems to enter 21 twice without leaving the first time
get the backslash the colon keys kids do not use but geeks do  what would milo want in here anyway
you calling phil and randy
come with me
now what are we doing i do not get any of this shit
you know my name
you know mine
you are famous around here
i am getting a teacher's pet rep
i would not worry about it you have gotta figure most people around here were their teachers' pets
were you
we moved around so much i barely knew my teachers
me too were you an army brat or something
what have you got there
graphical interfaces for skywire i am s'posed to coordinate with you
did you wanna be alone
mine's not the ceo he barely remembers to take a shower
right right but does he ever just like hand you code
maybe once i rewrote it anyway
you are compulsive
mmmmore like  i have a little trouble trusting people
why's that
so when you were talking about wishing people were more like computers was that then or now
that is great i  did not know
i snuck into 21
is that my  scenario  tell me
they would frame him
i always felt if a  boy i liked ever found out  he would run he would think i was unclean
what about the fbi
they have got this guy in the doj maybe others we tell the wrong person it is over
who can we trust
the mainstream media tv or a newsmagazine
right but gary's tiedin to a lot of media conglomerates have to be careful who we pick
we could crossreference a data base on media ownership but not on our own computers not even at home
it is a standard gui once i have got a concept it is maybe three day's work
gary knows i am close on skywire we have to do this fast
before they kill somebody else too
oh man i would have to get into gary's house to get the satellite positions
you mean  break in
why were you so careless
why were you snooping in my office
'think everybody in this place is here the same reason we are
i told teddy about you
what would he say
great i knocked off the aglet as soon as i get a passable version of skywire we are there
the dishes are juiced up too
thank god
same with the excerpts i am choosing they will play against any of the images you described
perfect  how am i gonna get away from the party long enough to

sir august merryweather i was looking for something relaxing say a tuscan hillside in june
of course natural weather delivered to your door on demand down your phoneline for limited periods
you do not say how real does it feel
as real as you wish hot or cold humid or dry anything you like within reason
how long have i been here
would that i could say the same
have we met
ah beautiful just as he promised
promised who promised
may i help you madam 
mr john steed please
you are female
as you see
then you cannot come in
i have an appointment
no women not in boodles not since 1922
sir august   sir august  
your voice  it is so familiar 
this is not a game
quite right but we still make the rules
rules are made to be broken
people too
my number two special assignments she is 
how curious 
would it be possible to use it for military purposes
i resign
you need treatment mrs peel  you cannot resign
what are you trying to do to me
the death of peter peel was a great loss to us all 
the institute  the funding 
this is an official matter mrs peel no need to take it personally where are you going
to find out who killed my husband
the doors and walls are monitored mrs peel this is a very secure establishment
about your next assignment mrs peel 
ahem as i was saying perhaps another macaroon 
good luck  peter  emma
a slight miscalculation  my face was burned beyond recognition fortunately my research into plastics came in handy 
dr darling peter  all you 
an unholy trinity 
you killed my husband
for starters of course i had to kill the teddy bears as well 
too many cooks 
spoil the majority shareholders in wonderland weather i planned everything even the ministry recruiting you 
but i found you all the clues led me here 
of course i planned that too
but  why
you disappoint me emma  cannot you guess  for you it was all for you 
'our revels now are ended'
think of this as your second wedding feast 
you know i believe she is actually jealous
valentine listen to me 
that is better i say is not this where you came in it is impenetrable by the way 
you are mad
such as
destruction of their local weather systems i can zap a thousand chernobyls into the air
the result would be 
chaos transport paralysis crop failure  economic disaster frostbite or sunburn  on a massive scale you have seen a few samples
doctor peel i presume
i was about to throw in the towel
i had a spot of bother at the door
i should not wonder not a woman inside boodles since 
1922 why the kippers
red herring would have been too obvious do not you think
so what was all this  some sort of test
congratulations you have penetrated a bastion of male privilege i guessed you were not a stickler for tradition doctor
whereas you are
dyed in the wool but i can admire someone who does not play by the rules
rules are made to be broken
not by me play by the rules doctor or the game is nothing
and just what is the game
i say this is all terribly formal must i go an calling you dr peel
under the circumstances you may call me mrs peel
 showers followed by sunny periods
ah  from trubshaw's  my shoemaker
my father always wanted a boy
really  i fail to see the connection
do you
i thought we were on our way
oh absolutely but trubshaw's a man worth meeting no point setting out half shod
you can but i wish you would not 
that place is so absurd so out of date 
you know what i mean this car  and you nobody walks around like that milk
and i suppose you are the knight
the most unpredictable piece on the board and always ready to protect his queen
sir august merryweather  why are we seeing him first
as per mother's instructions
do we always follow mother's instructions
they call me in when they have reached a dead end freelance like yourself
i have no choice why should you risk your life
after our fencing match i was rather hoping you would do the risking more tea
no thanks
not so much eccentric more barking mad he has a wife called june and a daughter somewhere  julie
june july  august
the family does seem to be somewhat meteorologically inclined
so  i distract him while you snoop around how
ah brenda   mrs peel
i was not about to
i mean your man trubshaw  your bulletproof waistcoat  i thought you were just overdressed
mother and dr darling have me under observation they think i tried to kill you
why should they think that
you told them you said i arrived on a camel shot you four times left you for dead
frankly that is how i remember it
but that is absurd i may not be overfond of you steed but it is not my style
did he say who
an invitation to a 'formal picnic'
i must say you look more your old self 
you mean my other self 
either way  may i ask why you dress in that fashion
colonel crabtree international satellite systems formerly of the ministry
elementary mrs peel trubshaw is not the only shoemaker still practicing his trade 
what on earth
any ideas
well he was a fellow of the royal zoological society 
is that written in his shoe
common knowledge mrs peel 
for you mrs peel
not quite this is my field
but if someone miniaturized the process
that is what we were working on
three agents killed by bad weather
 and by you mrs peel 
then a mad millionaire head of a secret defense establishment a group of eccentrics obsessed by weather 
 and by you mrs peel everything points to you  no sisters  no undiscovered twin
is that what you think
do you always drive this fast
this must be the last straw
here's the one that broke the camel's back
someone did not want us to get to the party
was i
i expect that is for you to know and me to find out 
to kill me
i could save you the trouble
no trouble
because you always obey orders 
and do you trust me
i could be convinced if  i knew who poisoned me in the maze that kiss 
mmm  what are you doing
keeping a stiff upper lip
but you did suspect me
not for a moment
you are playing games
are not we all mrs peel
i thought you played by the rules
i thought you did not
i am playing to win
winning is not everything
please do not tell me it is how you play the game
no after you
you do not trust me
i told mother i took care of you
you lied
drat someone wants to implicate you in this affair mrs peel any idea who
no idea who no idea why 
teddy bears cuckoo clocks toys all childrengs things 
 or grownups who still like to be children
quite any childhood friends enemies
his name's jones 'invisible' jones
why's he called 'invisible'
are not you coming
we must hurry mrs peel 
hurry  what for  i am just now 
there's a reception this evening colonel jones thinks it advisable we attend
that is that you are wearing
it is called black leather
what is it
limpet bomb small very compact from trubshaw's
when all this is over we simply must get you out of that suit
you first
trubshaw again what now
they are playing your song mrs peel
bad news father's looking for you where are those bloody ministers
i will be back 
where are you going
laying in supplies mrs peel weather may get very nasty and i have no umbrella 
you need not bother i cannot drag you further into this after all i am still the chief suspect
oh and by the way i think it is about time you got rid of that chip on your shoulder
mrs peel
what kept you
'the owl and the pussycat went to sea '
' in a beautiful pea green boat'
a fine night mrs peel 
still a bit chilly 
english weather you know after all we have been through i should say we deserve a long holiday 
have you any place in mind
i do not recall siberia being this warm steed
it is the latest thing mrs peel
our little paradise  just made for two
our chaperon
ah  sun tan lotion any shops nearby
your mission is simple find out how and why these agents died
think of it as special assignment mrs peel with a twist you are our chief suspect
where is mother
you do not believe him
ah here we are steed asked me to play a hunch  valentine peel
peter's brother  but 
now let's see  eton cambridge  research into robotics and plastics overtaken by peter's work on the physics of climate change 
i know all this
do you also know that during your final experiment your halfbrother inlaw was under surveillance
surveillance by whom
father she gave him an 'all clear' after a security test by dr darling
who's now vanished
makes two of us
i was getting to it
getting to what
the world council of ministers meets tomorrow to convene the new global defense initiative 
under the circumstances mother did not see fit but i think i can get you in 
privately owned by 
let me guess  wonderland weather
very good mrs peel 
i shall need a small plane
you are not venturing alone surely
a series of bizarre shifts in local weather patterns 
global warming
we know one thing that suspect was not mrs peel
oh hello 
we want mrs peel
how did you guess
you reek of mrs peel's black leather 
mother i thought you were burglars
weather's turning nasty
you did not come to talk about the weather surely
think she really killed those agents
something went wrong system malfunction explosion mrs peel had a narrow escape suspected sabotage nothing proven file still open
this man  did you see him
pity i was growing fond of mrs peel unfortunately 
guilty until proven innocent
i was hoping you could tell me
are you alright young man
cocky little bastard i hope he was a baddy
i feel sure of it
i am alice mother said you would be on your way mrs peel with you

wonderland weather ltd

green committed to a thousand  there's another fundraising party tonight marty would really like you to come
i could use a date

you think that is really any of your business
well you did invite me here
but rimgale's probably going to come around to arson
thanks for the invite
got anything to drink in there
do you miss it  you seem like you do
when i came back i knew more than anything else that i wanted to be a fireman
then why did you quit
brian that is wrong
 bullshit you knew what i told you was not ready for the papers 
i was doing my job
leave stephen out of this 
oh yeah he is the real fireman  who are you just another probie working for swayzak 
we still talking  look i am sorry about the other day 
swayzak knows something about the guys that were murdered i want to know why he keeps that hidden
i do not know anything about it
you could check it would be in his files
what is 
i am sorry
that is a dumb thing to say
i think your boss is going to need some spin control
i quit two days ago brian
what will you do
i do not have the slightest idea
i will see ya around huh
brian mccaffrey  oh this is really a treat brian mccaffrey lost a dad to the animal huh

uh i am brian mccaffrey your new assistant

uh i do not think that is in my contract
trychtichlorate is a binary structured 
 go to the bottom under heat properties
during heat episodes of 2000 kelvin or higher trych breaks down and dissipates will consume magnesium
but the right guess on this is arson
i do not guess
some people say you do not do much of anything when it comes to this case
that is why the sealant on the doors so what have we got a torch with a conscience
no we have a stone killer trying to make a point
are you going public with this
then who wrote the report
well brian i guess you can say it is arson now
just wondering
hi helen man you look great

sean come on out man what you forget your favorite uncle
well that is two things to strangle stephen for where is he anyway
oh man i am sorry

no need to be modest brian
every little boy's fantasy
brian let me come to the point i would like to offer you a job
mr mccaffrey
nice boat
completely out of control
are not you even curious
engine 115 right

i would prefer you not use that word in my presence
delacroix i am glad you got your mind right
we are all happy to be here and i am going to paint a picture for you
so let's take this great form this very american tradition of entertainment into the 21st century into the new millennium
the name of the show
i do not know if whoopi is the way to go
that is a great handle
mantan and sleep 'n eat  two real coons  i know we are way out there but it is satire
every week we follow the trials and tribulations of two real coons  mantan and sleep 'n eat  the dusky duo
what are there character traits
mantan is an uneducated negro who always by some stroke of unbelievable stupidity makes his best laid plans go haywire
and sleep 'n eat is his comical sidekick
yep you guessed it
protest finally forced amos and andy off the air  could stop us from ever getting on
mantan right here is a gifted hoofer  he has educated feet
we gonna hit 'em wid da bomb dickey on dis' one  that is the setting
that iswhati amtalkingabout that iswhati amtalkingabout  he is off the hizhook
we think so
you are telling me some white boy is gonna direct this pilot
i just want you to meet him  keep an open mind
what are his qualifications besides being a white male and directing a hot new sexy freaky madonna video
if spielburg can direct the color purple and amistad our whiz kid can direct the mantan pilot
i am gonna leave you two creative geniuses alone
i do not give a good goddamn about finland norway sweden or wherever ya blond ass came from
they did not even view a rough cut just some scenes we quickly cut together
this has to be a big mistake
the big mistake was my not believing in your genius earlier  from the gitgo from jump street
hold on a sec i got a call
hello mommy let me get rid of this other call
i gots to go it is my moms
what do you want
i want to speak with you
go away unless you got my money
son  good to seeya  good to seeya
it is been a long time
pull up a chair  oh excuse me this is my lady dot
good woman  i trained her right
daddy she is younger than me
purely for medicinal purposes
i did  i am not an alcoholic  i just like to drink
that is the only reason period they only want one certain kind of black comic
enough about me that is happening with you
dem white boys giving you a hard time
nuthing i cannot handle
the truth is never let them seeya sweat  you do that that is half the battle
where do you go from here
three nights charleston south carolina
i love you too daddy
glad to meet you too  you are all your father talks about
how long has my father been like this
not that often  he was excited to see you
so he drank himself into a stuper
the drinking is for the pain  it does not kill it just dulls it
do not tell him it is from me or he will not take it
he never showed it
how was it
why did not you tell me about this staff meeting
nobody told me anything
what good are you if you do not tell me stuff like this
how did you know
it hit me like a ton of bricks
how can this be  you and me at the same time the exact same thought it is scary
manray was under our nose the whole time
do you know how you will use him
what point is that
the point being that him the networks do not want black people on television unless they are buffoons
sounds risky to me
you getting cold feet
i am in till the end
good  i am going to need your support
you okay
what is your problem
my problem is mantan the new millenium minstrel show
even if money was not an issue dunwitty will still go ahead without me and that could be more dangerous
that is the chances of mantan being picked up
this is the group i was telling you about
which one is your brother
you have said that already
just want to say good luck
your life will never be the same
let's leave the man in peace so he can get ready
we both lied to him
what do you want me to say
same here
who's side are you on
what would their reaction be  i had not the foggiest
so you have your small victory now what
what is this
a gift
for what
the jolly nigger bank
i thought it was appropiate
how so
why would you do that
i do not want to hear it
how long have you and hambone been hanging out
you are the one that put us together we are friends
that crazy brother of yours does not think so
he is just playing big brother
oh is he  you getting jiggy with mantan
please do not go there
dunwitty and i feel you have been getting too close to him getting his mind all messed up
i cannot lie to him  if he asks me something i tell him what i think
this is crazy
that was a mistake but i do not regret it
the first and only time  a big mistake  i am gonna have to ask you not to see mantan anymore
otherwise  i trust you know the difference  you are an intelligent woman finished at nyu
dela kiss my big black ass
do not make me have to use this
i told you but you would not listen you never listened to me
yes your name
he i am mona
david i appreciate your comments anybody got an ideas  everybody just talk out loud
can i kiss you too
naw  i will take the zero
you feel good not nervous
i feel fine
not nervous  relaxed
so they can be on tv
you sound like the media
this is nothing  it will blow over by tomorrow
no joke  serious
hope the same thing does not happen to me  that is some big shoes to fill
you getting scared because some people do not like what you are doing
you should not even be mad at me over sloan
what you did is dead wrong
oh is it  buddy boy in this business if people do not produce they get fired
i do not believe it
mantan we got a show to tape
you must think i am some kind of fool
it looks delicious
you hear me talking to you  the only time you come up here when something is wrong
c'mon mommy do not start with that i am an ungrateful son stuff
it was  it is  but this is a different kind of show
if at first it is not what you want just work that much harder peerless
to answer your question there are a lot of negroes in it and what is your definition of buffoons
peerless i did not raise a buffoon we have enough of those on television already
peerless your father called
he wants you to come and see him
he said that
yes he did
where is he
he is performing at some place outside of richmond virginia
richmond is not all the way down south
i do not even know why you are still concerned over him  daddy's not with you
regardless he still is your father
it is gonna be hard for me to get away with the show taking off
you going to attack me too  the show is a hit  are not you happy for me
of course i am happy for you you have worked very hard for your success
not at all
you know how your daddy is
if and when he calls please do not forget to ask him if he is seen mantan
nice to meet you  if you do not mind me asking you  how old are you

oh you gonna make me say it

aw c'mon
forget about me are you a puppet for dela
do not try to change to the subject
why do not you answer
i know i will not be your puppet
you can go now
good day to you young sir
good morning
where are you bound for
that is none of your business
both of us ride home with best here
there's nothing else for it  take your ground grogan  twelve paces i suppose
ten sir and make them short ones do you hear captain grogan
pooh  pooh  best you are joking
ah  you sly rogue i see that will influence you
the place seems more a farm than an innyard
upon my word sir i think you have acted very coolly
i have acted as i think fit
good morning private james  please come in  i should like you to meet my uncle herr minister of police galgenstein
has he sent the challenge yet
this is a pretty way to recommend yourself to the family
dorothy might love me or not as she likes but best will have to fight me before he marries her
have you taken my message to him
the meeting is arranged  captain best is waiting for you now
my mare is saddled and ready who's the captaings second
and now you risk the same fate  if you are killed your mother is all alone in the world
i hope to spoil this sport and trust to see this sword of mine in that big bully's body
oh it is with pistols we fight  you are no match for best with the sword
not against castle dugan gate that has been off the hinges these ten years
i see you are thinking of a certain young lady at duganstown
is miss dugan well
there's only six miss dugans now poor dorothy
ah  i see  no i am afraid mine are the o'higgins of watertown
whom have i been harboring in my house  who are you sirrah
sirrah  sirrah i am as good a gentleman as any in ireland
you are an impostor young man a schemer a deceiver
chevalier though i cannot say how i believe you have cheated me
i deny your grace's accusations and beg you to say how you have been cheated
i do not know
where is my rascal lazlo
good gracious  what is this
you are going to drive to the frontier
ten thousand  but the scoundrel owes me seventy thousand
your honor must lower his voice
all europe shall hear of this
i have no luggage
you are the young man who m de seebach recommended
your name is lazlo zilagyi
yes sir
you come highly recommended by herr seebach
herr seebach was a very kind employer
for whom else have you worked
no one sir  before that i served in the army but had to leave due to weakness of the loins
who else can give me information about you
but they will prevent a meeting at whatever the cost
have no fear  it will come out well for me
i believe they will deport you
i have faced that problem before
it is distasteful to kill a scoundrel  that should be work for a hangman
to risk one's life against such people is an imposition
i entered here monsieur at a bad moment for you it seems that you love this lady
very well  now that i know it i will no longer love her
then you yield to me
on the instant  everyone must yield to such a nobleman as you
very well but a man who yields takes to his legs
that is a trifle strong
but for a time a passing fancy
not even that
how can i believe that there is not a man who has inspired desires in you
not one
have you not a man whom you value
that man has perhaps not yet been born
what  you have not met a man worthy of your attention
many worthy of attention but valuing is something more  i could value only someone whom i loved
it is nonetheless a misfortune and you will know it when you love
but if when i love i am unhappy i will know that my empty heart was my good fortune
i agree but god put us on earth to take that risk
a man may need to do that and find it amusing but a girl is bound by other laws
i believe you and i see i must hasten to leave for otherwise i shall become the unhappiest of men
how so
you want my heart
it is my only object
to make me wretched in two weeks
to love you until death  to subscribe to all your commands
the amusing thing is that you deceive me without knowing if it is true that you love me
and if she does not choose to show you some kindness
yes  but i am afraid of being deceived
poor man  and for that reason you want to begin where people end
lady cosgrove you are an old fool
i feel the ribbon
why are you shaking
i had not been in the room five minutes before i was engaged for every single set
i would draw my sword and cut my way through them
i am at your service mr cosgrove how much do you wish to spend
as much as possible
as much as possible
yes for i wish to entertain splendidly
all the same you must name an amount
last month the duke of suffolk spent no more
do you happen to know gustavus adolphus the thirteenth earl of crabs
does this assignment interest you
was he cheated
a meeting with the prince of turbingen is impossible
the king has determined to send the chevalier out of the country
then this must be done tomorrow
but i should not like to put you to such trouble mister
provided that they can be assured of her ladyship's freewill  are you serious
may i be quite frank with you
did you buy the horse papa
now just have a little patience my boy  your birthday is not until next week
but i will have it on my birthday will not i
good night papa
i promise your lordship a good flogging if you even so much as go to doolangs farm to see him
your bother is in america fighting the rebels
is he all right papa
would you have me spend my life all alone
in truth sir yes but if you must marry then marry a virtuous drudge
good evening mr james have you done with my lady
i beg your pardon
charming schuvaloff
blackeyed sczortarska
dark valdez
do you expect me to believe that your lover brought you here tonight
yes  he brought me in his carriage and he will call for me at midnight
and he does not care about me
he is only curious to know who you are
if his love were like mine he would not permit you to come here
he loves me as i love you
do not like 'em do not eat 'em do not make no damn difference to me
can i at least have a drink
it is ten thirty in the morning
yeah if you have slept
you know the law  no liquor before noon could lose my license
do not you ever point a gun at me
fuck what the fuck is going on 
what do we do
did  did you 
what about pike
he is the only one unaccounted for
this is not our area whose area is this 
hey i   holy fuck holy fuck what the fuck did you guys do
you killed him you fucking faggot 
we got  i do not know we got separated
before or after the explosion  mueller 
west was one thing but this 
we finished the course and came here then heard an explosion   where is pike
what about you wandering around alone at least we have an alibi 
holy fuck holy fuck what the fuck did you guys do
yeah right
why not
i asked for a policeman
you are under military arrest it is not gonna happen that is wrong with baseball
it is too slow
well it is a game of anticipation that is the beauty
i just do not like it
i do not know i like the army
c'mon ray everyone hates the army during basic i will tell you straight i hated it here
there's no need
why would you ask for a cop ray
i am not telling you what happened
and those were the guys who went on the exercise with you
hey ray just had a nice talk with your buddy kendall  seems you killed three people
that son of a bitch
that would be my reaction too 
he is lying
well why did not you say so we will just drop all your charges then 
i did not shoot west 
i apologize 
you saw west's body
you shot childs and nunez
they would have killed us both you want me to write a confession i will write a confession
you saved kendall's life 
we are not finished yet 
we do not need the tapes 
oh you do not what else do you have on me you have not found any bodies yet have you
he  he made me do it 
do what
i guess nunez was not dead after all he came after us with a vengeance  you know the rest
and the bodies
i promised them i would ask you where west and the others are
washout rejects guys he said were dumbfucks too stupid to know they dead
that first night with pike i made the mistake of letting him sit down at around 0300
tell us about the other guys the ones west weeded out
he said he worked there 
no did he tell you about it about the business childs ran
what business
what about the phosphorous grenade
back up
why did not you tell us all this in the first place
is that what i did now and of course you can prove all of it
ohhhh i do not think so
cadet that is your name
sir dunbar sir
you know how to work a pistol dunbar
sir yes sir
what the fuck is going on
he would not kill anybody
jesus what happened
pike and i got separated then i heard gunfire close
whose blood is that jay
what do you mean west's
where have you been jay
roberto what the fuck
you know it is not like that 
you gotta untie me  i did not do this thing ray
you hated west more than any of us
maybe but that do not make me a killer 
you are the only one missing a grenade
that is exactly what he says about you
you hated west mueller loved him 
combat grade morphine mueller sold it to me
you are lying 
why why did not you tell me
that still does not mean you did not kill him
you saw west right how was he killed
full clip to the body 
from up close or far away
i i do not know
what do not you know
a test will no doubt link you to the killing 
you i have seen you around the base but you  you are not army are you
i have done nothing wrong  i am the victim here
you said you wanted to know what happened  i am telling you the truth
what happened to degrees
i did not kill him 
but you did not
he admitted it
okay i think that is it he rises and walks to the door
you tried to pin three stone murders on dunbar 
how many murders did you cover up one five maybe an even ten
epileptic attacks are murder on your system rattle your internal organs like a paint mixer
is it the truth
something funny levi
jail if he is lucky the gas chamber if he is not 
how do you know
or you levi when is it finally going to come out that you were the one who killed him
i did not 
you lied to us levi you are going to the gas chamber unless you tell us where to find them
i do not know 
maybe what 
how are you
been better  i read about that is been happening with you i should have called 
that bad
would i have called you if it was not if there was any other way 
this is warrant officer julia osborne the closest thing we have to an in house investigator
i am assuming that is what made him the dead one
which gives us about five hours why would you call me
the guy in interrogation said he would only talk to a cop
he is not done by a longshot i can get more out of him 
pike killed west dunbar killed mueller childs and nunez
who killed pike
we have already been over the terrain twice nothing
there was a hurricane bill the wind probably moved it
habeas corpus  you have to have a body to have a crime
okay then let's widen the search to include the endzone in giants stadium and the trunk of my car 
nevertheless what' kendall will testify and that will be enough
you mean not enough to save you
tom where are you going 
home i am done
what i said before 
that is horseshit and you know it
they are taking your command are not they
i am sorry bill
do not be i am not cut out to deal with the west's of the world
you are a good soldier bill
you are drunk 
stay where you are
or what you have gone round the bend 
for the last time i have no idea what you are talking about 
hostile and uncooperative
ah christ
you knew sergeant west
i did not mean that as a compliment
sergeant west's served for twenty three years he is the public face of the modern army
gotta be honest i love what you have done with the place 
you and the colonel go back
it was for suspicion of bribery it is really all in the wording 
wording and your friendship with the colonel aside i am not comfortable having you involved in this
hurricane knocked out our mainframe so all we have are their dogtags cadets raymond dunbar and levi kendall 
levi who names their kid levi 
senator jonathan kendall of ohio
because interrogation rooms look suspiciously like interrogation rooms which does not exactly put people at ease is he cute
excuse me
is dunbar cute
good copbad cop
i believe somebody owes me ten dollars 
you really want to make banal chit chat like that now
you are right we should sit in silence
we are in the middle of a murder case 
typical army brat story dad was noncom mom was a nurse there was never any real doubt of joining up
you had a mobile of bayonets above your crib
something like that you
this is the straight hitting on me you were talking about is not it
the very same
you do understand that there's absolutely no way i could ever be attracted to you right
i plan to grow on you
you are off to a late start
you guys really got the shit kicked out of you here
imagine what it must have been like for them out there what do you think of dunbar
he is telling the truth up to a point
something wrong
being back here gives me the willies
remember he is the son of a senator so go easy kid gloves
that was kid gloves
but we have to question him   thought you did not have cigarettes 
too neat how long have you been an investigator
i just he came back for kendall i do not think he is capable of murder
why the fuck was not he in restraints
goddammit hardy you cannot just leave 
watch me
you did more than try you cracked dunbar in less than three minutes as an investigator you are phenomenal 
at least you and kendall agree on that
they believe the innocent are guilty and the guilty are innocent
kendall maybe would have agreed but the hurricane buttfucks the cabin 
that bugs you too
little bit
we are fucked i know 
are you sure
why do not you talk to levi off the record for a second
i pushed him too hard
you could not have known 
yeah i could have should have
so what now
now i go home get drunk and try and forget this ever happened
for what
we got maybe three minutes till they break it down
hardy what are you doing 
we can tie you to the chair if it will work better for you 
hardy for chrissakes 
no bodies no west
that is not true
there are degrees of truth officer always degrees
do i have a choice in this
what are you doing out here
leaving without saying goodbye what are you gonna do
go home get drunk and try and forget this ever happened
your phone number
he was your friend
the thing is we have got a real opportunity here you turn me in tomorrow and we are both fucked 
pike please 
maybe we should not go
the faggot speaks
you ever been in a hurricane mueller
they found him poor fucker was practically blown in half 
poor fucker my ass
pike and i got separated 
yeah and he does not know when 
i remember now it was before the explosion 
oh you remember now 
i was freezing from the hurricane 
we just want 
he could not kick you out so he wanted you to quit on your own
he said what
you are gonna die tonight faggot clear as day
no one else heard it
nunez was chasing dunbar
because he would shot mueller
pike never confessed
running out of time are we tick tock ticktock how long till your witnesses fly the coop
dunbar says you were
dunbar's telling the truth
wrong answer 
what happened with nunez
hurricane's due after midnight and we are still going out
whoever shot the sarge blew a grenade first 
thank god
this place is going mueller we gotta move 
where is your shirt mueller
goddammit ray we gotta get out of here 
cadet michael mueller i hereby place you under military arrest for the murder of sergeant nathan west 
the fuck are you talking about 
until we return to base and ballistics can match your weapon to the slugs in sergeant west's body 
tell him to shut up 
funny i swear i saw them bring him and the smaller guy in this morning
no no that was cadet dunbar 
this is totally unnecessary 
he asked to see a policeman we are getting him a policeman
he is not army it is not official 
what do you think
you want kendall do not you
we know
you never told me why you got kicked out of
great great that is fantastic
hey kid your friend just made himself a star
see the big guy likes it
i just saw the woman i am going to marry i know it but then i lost her
tough break most men have to get married before they lose their wives
i am going to spend the rest of my life looking for her that or die alone
i know her uncle friends of the family
who is she where does she live
did not kill anything did i
a few rabbits but i think one of them was already dead
her name is sandra templeton she is going to auburn the semester's almost over so you better hurry

i thought you were not dying
why not religion dad
josephine actually went to the congo last year

you do not have to
i talked with your father last night
you never told me how your parents met
they met at auburn
what about the details how they fell in love the circus the war you never told me any of that

everyone loves my father he is a very likeable guy
but it is not true
you are not
i need you on my side
what happened
your father had a stroke he is upstairs with your mom and dr bennett

how much time does he have left
i do not know if you have seen it but josephine has some photos in the most recent newsweek
mom would you say you understand dad

that really happened
is he awake
did you and dad have any other property

so you never bought any land
i will stay why do not you go home with josephine and i will stay tonight
mom do you want some time with dad

when we went to the hard rock cafe who paid when we went to see 'cats' who paid
those are not presents that is normal friendship stuff
yeah it was okay
yeah it was quite good actually some bits i really liked
sixty four thousand eight hundred
it is enough is not it
what do you mean
you know what i mean babe it is enough we can stop
that is this
it is nothing i burnt myself
that is not a burn
say thank you
a baby what are we supposed to do with a baby
what what are you doing
what you are what you are with this creep now
leave him
you have you have actually fallen for this prick
you can see why it is sensitive
how is that we cannot drink our piss can we
hang on hang on sorry but like who are you
you must find some glasses small for the toast and some plates
sorry you have lost me
what did he say
i need to know who you are first please
oh  we are russian
hold on
so hang on you are both nadia's cousins
what was that
i asked her if you were happy to see us i find it hard to tell with you
so how long will you be in england
plans are for the architects politicians and so forth
you must have a visa or something
you are asking for my documents
she says 'hello' to you go for it john
uh do you like england
what was that
oh nothing
tell me
no it is too judgmental
tell me what he said
you are not ashamed of it it is no surprise to want to love
no it is not that
do you believe in love
how is bank
fine i thought you were leaving today
i understand i am so sorry
you can stay tonight
i have brought you trouble maybe i should have come alone
what does he want the russian shithead what do you want 
he wants money
he wants a lot of money
i will give him money tell him to put the
he wants the money from your bank
i will fucking give it to him we will go down there
you do not understand he wants all the money that is in your bank
oh jesus
he is sure you can do this of course you can not
just leave her alone
i am so sorry
i do not understand
they go john they go
that is wrong
they go
of course they go yes yes
it is makes it easier okay
i do not want to know
it makes it faster if i do not speak to the men they fall faster it is pretty obvious why
even so i always felt the decision to burst in and rob it very much remained with me
why else would you send off for me if you just wanted sex just go to a prostitute
you must think i am the biggest pillock in the world
no i do not
in the world
i know you just want to punish me 
i do i want to very badly
so you are just going to be vindictive
in every sense if at all possible
you cannot hurt me more than i am hurt already
i am going to be sick where is the
what no you are not
i am going i am i am going to be sick
you do not have to do this i can look after myself
give me some money
so uh alexei which i know is not his name
it is none of your business
so uh
look if you want to know is he better in bed than you then yes he is
oh jesus
if what you want to know is does he have a bigger cock than you then yes he does
of course of course of course he does of course thank you thanks
not the kids type then is he not that broody you must be pretty miffed
he will come back
excuse me
he left me my passport and ticket it is pretty clear he wants to see me again
yeah i tend to tie up and abandon women i really want to see again too
i do not want to talk about it
why not
shut up i am not listening
we will pretend it never happened
so that is it like having to fuck men you hate
and what are you saying
and it is wrong
and who says what is wrong
and that would be morals that would be one's own moral sense of decency
that is a moral orgasm john tell me how it feels exactly
so what then you just detach sex from everything
whereas wet 'ng wild is an emotional journey tied and tethered it is pretty moving huh like anna karenina
sometimes which
sometimes neither
some what does that mean
there's nothing wrong in liking sex john
so now you hate all women
i think it is my safest bet do not you
i got what i paid for
it was not what i wanted
so what did you want i think we understand each other no
you do not understand me
excuse me
get out
you are throwing me out
you know in russia there's no work for women it is a different world
you do not have to say anything
what i i was not saying
please there's no oh
i was not saying anything
fifteen you do not know him he was very kind and strong
yeah he is a smashing bloke
the rest of the world john it is not all like st albans

it that mother real
of course he is not real  you think i would be working here if i could afford a real snake
it is a good job
the best
does it eat
you would be surprised what a guy will go through to get a glimpse of a beautiful body
i bet i would
it is artificial
are you apprehensive
why should i be
i would not accept it  also i would report the person who gave it to me to the police
i would take him to the doctor
you are watching tv and suddenly you notice a wasp crawling on your wrist
in a magazine you come across a fullpage photo of a nude girl
you become pregnant by a man who runs off with your best friend and you decide to get an abortion
i would never get an abortion
why not
that would be murder mr deckard
in your opinion
it would be my child
is there anything else
i know you think it complicates your work but i am here to help
i have already got more help than i need
sounds like i am an asshole either way but the answer is still no
two of us might be more effective than one
i can imagine
do not just stand there looking at me  it is not polite
you ever take a bath with a man before
i told you i would come back
you did
who is this
me and my dad

this feels stupid
you are sick deckard
have you ever known anybody a long time
that is a long time
ten years
why do you call it retire why do not you call it murder
because it is not
do not you think anything that can suffer deserves to be considered
andies only simulate suffering  if they are programmed for it
do you think i simulated what happened between us
do not leave here  do not open the door do not answer the phone
what difference will it make
where the hell you been

that is up
severed spine  you would better get in here  bryant's waiting for you

but in your profession that is a risk
nothing is infallible but so far the voightkampff scale bas been foolproof
like you said mr deckard a machine can be a hazard  the voightkampff scale is a machine is not it
one that relies on human interpretation  where is the subject
if she is the machine works
she did not know
how many questions does it usually take mr deckard
we are going to have to start the sequence again if you do not stay with me deckard  concentrate

plus where is huggie bear

i think you might of dreamed this one anthony
as part of his plan i do not know why
see that is what i am saying it has the logic of a dream
the point is the killer always goes may i speak to starsky he says his name
what does starsky say
he says this is he
this is he
did you see what i meant about the window
kind of except we have already got the keys
that is true but what if they change the locks
would they do that
now that window can never be locked it is impossible
she is really kind of hot
it is got a v8 dignan
anthony we will get two hundred for the coin collection alone that is less than what it is appraised at
but dignan do you really know that much about rare coins
the list dignan i know you remember the list because you signed it things dignan was not supposed to touch
where are you going
i do not appreciate you ridiculing me
did you see that
yeah i saw it
i am lookout
dignan it is got an alarm
i do not think so just reach on in
that sets it off
it had an alarm
yeah i heard that
holy shit what would i tell you
eight dollars
but he did not say anything
loop around real fast
you think we are going to be chased
now one thing we need to discuss is timing timing is absolutely crucial what are you doing anthony
anthony give me the fucking gun
dignan calm down
you are out i am not working with either one of you
calm down take a deep breath
where is the manager
where is the other stocker
there's another stocker right
is that the manager
holy shit
i swear to god in a very quiet voice
like he would find dignan one day
that is wrong with him
what do you think
anthony he sat in the car and watched a 411 in progress he got what he deserved
can i get that credit card from you
i do not like to use that credit card dignan
why not
because my mom gets the bill
she is not going to notice anthony
i do not want to use it
well then cut it in half
i keep it for emergencies
see if mine are in there
dignan those are not running shoes
yes they are
look at the treads on those
what about them
they obviously were not designed for racing
do not call me spoiled dignan
i will just say it
i will say it
ok go ahead
look man she did not know anything about shirts
no i am not saying her i am just saying i do not know
armored trucks are very difficult to steal anthony
i know but once you get inside you are home free
right get back to me on that one once your plan is worth a shit
no dignan i am sorry i cannot do that
i thought you guys went to get your hair cut
inez this is 
what the fuck is going on here
what that is the matter
anthony we are on the run from the law here did you tell these people your real name
no i did not dignan they do not speak english
they do not
no not really inez speaks a little
which one was that
she is from cuba
he needs to hire an attorney
as long as he gets out ok
see now we have got a plan
after that my parents never let me go to dignangs again
but if it was not for dignan i probably would of died
he is gone he stole the car
where was it parked
that coward son of a bitch
he went back for his brother
we said 48 hours
when would he tell you
this morning
where was i
you were asleep
he told you and you let him do it
he told me because he wanted to know if i wanted to go
if you wanted to go what were you going to do just leave me here by myself
bob went to help his brother i understand that and i cannot help it if you do not
i understand that if i had a few more friends like you and bob i would be dead
i did not realize you had such an incredible ability to feel sorry for yourself dignan
we are going over to this bar if you feel like going
i cannot believe he just jumped you
i wish i would been there
inez has a master key to all these rooms does not she  does not she
i do not think we can do that
i know we can it is real simple we go into a room grab some car keys and 
what i am saying is she would not go for that
she does not need to know
no one to back me up now i have a good idea so unless you come up with something better 
i do not think we need any keys dignan i think i can hotwire a car for us
you do not know how to hotwire
yes i do bob taught me
bob taught you how to get electrocuted
i think we better go home
do not panic anthony
i am not but there's 
you cannot just run home every time things get tough first of all we have got enough dough to 
our money situation is not good
you are so spoiled what is not good to you only a few hundred 
we have got sixteen dollars
sixteen dollars
i know
i had to give some to inez
you gave $383 to the goddamn housekeeper what the fuck is your problem
she needed it
a $500 tip for the housekeeper
her name's inez stop calling her the housekeeper
that is what she is
i know that but 
you are in love with the fucking housekeeper

you got to be kidding me
i am not kidding
what would he get
pretty much everything
you think applejack knew
mr henry never gave you a test did he
you are living on a sailboat
it belongs to bob's uncle
how big is it

that is he in for
i think i may have found a way out of here
you are kidding

scale the barricade and tunnel through no mangs land and bob remember

you mean like techniques
i would like to live in that place hinckley cold storage
you mean a safecracker
tell me something what the hell kind of name is dignan
i am not really sure i think it is irish or maybe 
i guess what i am trying to say is what the hell kind of person is this dignan
and you are wrong if you think i would turn my back on a friend
congratulations you passed the test
what do you mean
that was a test
how does that feel
did dignan take the test
yes he did
no that door over there
i do not want to die
the fear of death the pain of consciousness  did you mix this martini
no bob did
bob bob that is a palindrome  i love palindromes
are you afraid to die mr henry
we are renegades from despair
why would you want to help us
what do herbs have to do with it i do not understand the 
in your backyard how do you protect them
it is private property plus i have hector
hector woud not do anything
could you grow cinnamon

let them fight
are you serious
see you
you will probably have them the rest of your life
what the fuck is dignan doing with that cop he loves them
there's a million places to hide around here
oh yeah they will never catch the guy
i hope not
why do not you just tell them the truth those belong to my neighbor phil
i do not know i personally do not need that shit in my life right now
will you guys shut up god it is like having two little kids in the car
you think he got my license plates
how long are they going to hold him
anthony i 
bob where you going
i am not playing any more golf
why not
cause i am not getting any better it is a waste of time
you have only been playing for two weeks bob it takes a long time to learn this game
you think i am improving
you do not have to talk about it if you do not want to
no i do not mind
i know it must of been a bad experience but it does not sound like it was your fault
that is pretty complicated for a senior prank
why were you drawing the holy mary
i thought he did not have to pay anything because of the technicality
yeah but he still has the aggravation three days sitting in a cell
were you adopted bob
why do you say that
well because you guys do not look alike

i can knock a man out with a six inch punch
what do you mean
where would they come from
the front stairs

we might have to take that chance cause i feel pretty strongly about this
is that him
that is anthony
wait did he see us
i do not know why the fuck we are having a party the damn job's not over yet
well this is not really a party per se

well what do you think
i am not allowed to drive those
i thought your parents were in italy

so who's going to know
he looks like he was designed by scientists for desert warfare
that never would of 
if you are that worried maybe we should just steal one
what are you talking about bob
you stole a transam
yes i did
ok bob
it is true dignan
well what do you want to do you want to steal one or just drive your car
how much could you grow realistically
as much as i want when these plants bud i will probably have about six thousand dollars worth of weed
six thousand dollars come on bob
if it is that easy why does not everybody grow them
do not you guys tell anybody about my plants
you are paranoid bob
what was that all about
i cannot believe you said that
what did i say
the guy is fucking insane
i warned you dignan
you said it like it was a big joke bob like he is wild
no i was saying crazy like a lunatic
i know that now he is a fucking psycho
well do not blame me i told you
where would she go
i think we might of scared her
that is my responsibility
i am paying attention i just want to look at it for a minute
that is your fucking problem you are a shithead
i paid for it
you know bob anthony did kill someone he electrocuted our janitor senior year
his name was swifty
yeah one of the nicest old guys you would ever know

but it is not his how can they arrest future man
i do not think they can make it stick bob i mean what do they actually have on future man
well the marijuana crop is a good start
that could be anybody's
they also found my two beam scale in the garage
since when is it a crime to have a scale in your house everybody has a scale
the cops say it is a special kind of scale drug dealers use in selling marijuana
so tell them the truth what do you use it for
how long has he been in there
i do not know
then how come they have not set the bail yet that is unconstitutional
what do you mean get back

you felt nothing no spark two young people in paris dangerous missions life and death
you mean did i want a date
did you
these were killers conklin had them all jacked up they were dobermans

i will invade england and defeat the english on their own ground
a thousand  you have made me guardian of scotland so i tell you this is what we face
we cannot defeat this 
with cavalry  not heavy like the english but light fast horsemen like you nobles employ  we could outmaneuver their bowmen

a common thief
we must run in different directions
we do not split up
i am the one who is rotting but i think your face looks graver than mine

so more men were slaughtered uselessly
in my heart i had begun to hope that he would never break
where is my son
i sent for him  and the little coward send you
shall i leave m'lord
my songs loyal wife returns unkilled by the heathen so he accepted our bribe
no he did not
you spoke with this wallace in private what kind of man is he

treason against whom
against thy king thou vile fool hast thou anything to say
never in my whole life did i swear allegiance to your king

a journal just have him write down everything he does
and the bad news
unfortunately we have got nothing to work with it is harder playing detective now
but you must have something to go on
if i had to guess i would say the blackouts are stress related
come on i doubt the answer's that simple

and you want to know 
 will he keep his word
you want my advice
oh yes please
monsieur rick i 
you will find a market there for this ring i am forced to sell it at a great sacrifice
thank you but i hardly think 
what is your name
such a bargain but that is your decision
mr berger the ring could i see it again
yes monsieur
i recognize you from the news photographs monsieur laszlo
in a concentration camp one is apt to lose a little weight
monsieur rick may i get you a cup of coffee
no thanks carl
well you are in pretty good shape herr rick
how long can i afford to stay closed
oh two weeks maybe three
maybe i will not have to a bribe has worked before in the meantime everybody stays on salary
now you finish locking up will you carl
i will then i am going to the meeting of the 
 do not tell me where you are going
the police break up our meeting herr rick we escaped in the last moment
yes i come
i want you to turn out the light in the rear entrance it might attract the police
but sacha always puts out that light 
 tonight he forgot
i want you to take miss lund home
excuse me monsieur rick but a gentleman inside has won twenty thousand francs the cashier would like some money
well i will get it from the safe
i am so upset monsieur rick you know i cannot understand 
 forget it emil mistakes like that happen all the time
here you are
it shall not happen again monsieur
here's to you sir
er good luck yes
i would better be going
er my check please
er goodbye sir
hello rick
hello ferrari how is business at the blue parrot
fine but i would like to buy your cafe
it is not for sale
you have not heard my offer
it is not for sale at any price
what do you want for sam
suppose you run your business and let me run mine
suppose we ask sam maybe he would like to make a change
suppose we do
i see the bus is in i will take my shipment with me
the bourbon  the news about ugarte upset me very much
practically no one
if i could lay my hands on those letters i could make a fortune
and the carrying charges
naturally there will be a few incidental expenses that is the proposition i have for whoever has those letters
i will tell him when he comes in
rick i will put my cards on the table i think you know where those letters are
that is why i came over here to give them a chance to ransack my place
shall we draw up the papers or is our handshake good enough
hmmm i happen to know that he gets ten percent but he is worth twenty five
and abdul and carl and sacha they stay with the place or i do not sell
of course they stay rick's would not be rick's without them
do not forget you owe rick's a hundred cartons of american cigarettes
yes something
do you know where they are
it was gracious of you to share it with me good day mademoiselle monsieur
and mademoiselle
mademoiselle after this disturbance it is not safe for laszlo to stay in casablanca
this morning you implied it was not safe for him to leave casablanca
that is also true except for one destination to return to occupied france
occupied france
uh huh under a safe conduct from me
what value is that you may recall what german guarantees have been worth in the past
there are only two other alternatives for him
what are they
it is possible the french authorities will find a reason to put him in the concentration camp here
and the other alternative
 it was la belle aurore
how nice you remembered but of course that was the day the germans marched into paris
i remember every detail the germans wore gray you wore blue
say goodnight to sam for me
i will
there's still nobody in the world who can play as time goes by like sam
who are you really and what were you before what did you do and what did you think huh
we said no questions
a franc for your thoughts
in america they would bring only a penny i guess that is about all they are worth
i am willing to be overcharged tell me
why i am so lucky why i should find you waiting for me to come along
why there is no other man in my life
uh huh
that is easy there was he is dead
i am sorry for asking i forgot we said no questions
richard they will find out your record it will not be safe for you here
my germangs a little rusty
with the whole world crumbling we pick this time to fall in love
yeah it is pretty bad timing where were you say ten years ago
ten years ago let's see  yes i was having a brace put on my teeth where were you

strange i know so very little about you
but be serious darling you are in danger and you must leave paris

well you can tell me now i am reasonably sober
i do not think i will rick
all the same someday you will lie to laszlo you will be there
how did you get in
richard i had to see you
you can ask any price you want but you must give me those letters
it was your cause too in your own way you were fighting for the same thing
richard richard we loved each other once if those days meant anything at all to you 
 i would not bring up paris if i were you it is poor salesmanship
 all right i tried to reason with you i tried everything now i want those letters get them for me
i do not have to i have got them right here
huh but it is still a story without an ending what about now
now i do not know i know that i will never have the strength to leave you again
all right i will here's looking at you kid
richard victor thinks i am leaving with him have not you told him
no not yet
but it is all right is not it you were able to arrange everything
everything is quite all right
but why my name richard
because you are getting on that plane
i do not understand what about you
maybe not today maybe not tomorrow but soon and for the rest of your life
hello sam
it is been a long time
yes ma'am a lot of water under the bridge
some of the old songs sam
where is rick
when will he be back
not tonight no more he ai not coming uh he went home
you used to be a much better liar sam
leave him alone miss ilsa you are bad luck to him
play it once sam for old time's sake
i do not know what you mean miss ilsa
play it sam play as time goes by
you are very kind
this time they really mean to stop me
victor i am afraid for you
i must find out what berger knows
be careful
we are only interested in two visas signor
please ilsa do not be hasty
he does could we have a table close to him
what happened with rick
our faithful friend is still there
victor please do not go to the underground meeting tonight
did he give any reason
he suggested i ask you
ask me
yes victor i was
i know how it is to be lonely  is there anything you wish to tell me
no victor there is not
yes yes i know victor whatever i do will you believe that i that 
be careful
are you ready ilsa
he came from paris with rick
rick who's he
mademoiselle you are in rick's and rick is 
hello rick
well then perhaps you also 
i am afraid major strasser would insist
how do you do
how do you do
one hears a great deal about rick in casablanca
and about victor laszlo everywhere
and i congratulate you
what for
your work
thank you i try
i hope we did not overstay our welcome
we will come again
good morning
good evening
good evening you see here we are again
monsieur blaine i wonder if i could talk to you
go ahead
well is not there some other place it is rather confidential what i have to say
what of it
is not it strange that you always happened to be fighting on the side of the underdog
are you enough of a businessman to appreciate an offer of a hundred thousand francs
i appreciate it but i do not accept it
i will raise it to two hundred thousand
my friend you could make it a million francs or three my answer would still be the same
there must be some reason why you will not let me have them
there is i suggest that you ask your wife
i beg your pardon
i said ask your wife
well this might come in handy
thank you
had a close one eh
you love her that much
monsieur blaine i do not know how to thank you
i brought the money monsieur blaine
keep it you will need it in america
but we made a deal
oh never mind about that you will not have any trouble in lisbon will you
no it is all arranged
everything in order
all except one thing there's something you should know before you leave
i understand
i am captain renault prefect of police
let us say that it is my request that is a much more pleasant word
my bill
well a precedent is being broken er emil
ricky you are becoming quite human i suppose we have to thank you for that mademoiselle
tomorrow at ten at the prefect's office
i am delighted to see you both did you have a good night's rest
i slept very well
that is strange nobody is supposed to sleep well in casablanca
may we proceed with the business
with pleasure will not you sit down
i am afraid not my regrets monsieur
and the honor of having served the third reich
monsieur insofar as it is in my power 
 thank you
i believe you have a message for him
i have never accepted that privilege and i am now on french soil
i should like to discuss some matters arising from your presence on french soil
this is hardly the time or the place
then we shall state another time and another place tomorrow at ten in the prefect's office with mademoiselle
for the time being
unoccupied france welcomes you to casablanca
thank you captain it is very good to be here
what else my dear major
by the way the murder of the couriers what has been done
oh there is no hurry tonight he will be at rick's everybody comes to rick's
good evening gentlemen
thank you it is a pleasure to have you here major
champagne and a tin of caviar
may i recommend veuve cliquot '26 a good french wine
especially so tonight major in a few minutes you will see the arrest of the man who murdered your couriers
rick this is major heinrich strasser of the third reich
you repeat third reich as though you expected there to be others
well personally major i will take what comes
ho diplomatist
rick is completely neutral about everything and that takes in the field of women too
if rick has the letters he is much too smart to let you find them there
you give him credit for too much cleverness my impression was that he is just another blundering american
as to laszlo we want him watched twentyfour hours a day
you see captain the situation is not as much under control as you believe
but everybody's having such a good time
yes much too good a time the place is to be closed
but i have no excuse to close it
what is the meaning of that phone call
why do you stand here why do not you stop him
hello louis
you know i think now i shall pay a call on yvonne maybe get her on the rebound eh
the plane to lisbon  you would like to be on it
why that is in lisbon
it was a combination of all three
and what in heavengs name brought you to casablanca
my health i came to casablanca for the waters
waters what waters we are in the desert
rick there's going to be some excitement here tonight we are going to make an arrest in your cafe
what again
if you are thinking of warning him do not put yourself out he cannot possibly escape
i stick my neck out for nobody
how observant you are as a matter of fact i wanted to give you a word of advice
yeah that is his name
victor laszlo
rick that is the first time i have ever seen you so impressed
it will be interesting to see how he manages
manages what
his escape
oh but i just told you 
 stop it he escaped from a concentration camp and the nazis have been chasing him all over europe
this is the end of the chase
is that a serious offer
i just paid out twenty i would like to get it back
done no matter how clever he is he still needs an exit visa or i should say two
why two
he is traveling with a lady
maybe he is not quite as romantic as you are
it does not matter there is no exit visa for him
louis whatever gave you the impression that i might be interested in helping laszlo escape
and got well paid for it on both occasions
the winning side would have paid you much better
maybe well it seems you are determined to keep laszlo here
i have my orders
yeah you were saying
oh how do you do
that makes rick a citizen of the world
well you were asking about rick and here he is mademoiselle may i present 
oh no rick never 
louis are you provichy or free french
serves me right for asking a direct question the subject is closed
as i suspected you are a rank sentimentalist
yeah why
why do you interfere with my little romances
how can you close me up on what grounds
and i am taking a friend with me one you will appreciate
it certainly would germany vichy would be very grateful
i see how do i know you will keep your end of the bargain
oh thanks
you are late
i was informed just as laszlo was about to leave the hotel so i knew i would be on time
i thought i asked you to tie up your watchdogs
you know this place will never be the same without you ricky
yes i know what you mean but i have already spoken to ferrari you will still win at roulette
i have the letters right here
tell me when we searched the place where were they
sam's piano
 not so fast louis nobody's going to be arrested not for a while yet
have you taken leave of your senses
i have sit down over there
i suppose you know what you are doing but i wonder if you realize what this means
i do we have got plenty of time to discuss that later
if you do not mind you fill in the names that will make it even more official
you think of everything do not you
well i was right you are a sentimentalist
well rick you are not only a sentimentalist but you have become a patriot
maybe but it seemed like a good time to start
and that ten thousand francs should pay our expenses
our expenses
uh huh
where were you last night
that is so long ago i do not remember
will i see you tonight
give me another
sacha she is had enough
rick i am sick and tired of having you 
come on we are going to get your coat
make it official if you like
what is your nationality
i understand you came here from paris at the time of the occupation
there seems to be no secret about that
are you one of those people who cannot imagine the germans in their beloved paris
well there are certain sections of new york major that i would not advise you to try to invade
aha who do you think will win the war
my interest in whether victor laszlo stays or goes is purely a sporting one
in this case you have no sympathy for the fox huh
you will excuse me gentlemen your business is politics mine is running a saloon
i would advise you not to interfere
put that phone down
get me the radio tower
uh excuse me please hello rick
well what makes you think i have not
oh nothing but when you first came to casablanca i thought 
may i too bad about those two german couriers was not it
they got a lucky break yesterday they were just two german clerks today they are the 'honored dead'
i forgot you never drink with  i will have another please  you despise me do not you
i do not mind a parasite i object to a cutrate one
well rick after tonight i will be through with the whole business and i am leaving finally this casablanca
who did you bribe for your visa renault or yourself
for how long
perhaps an hour perhaps a little longer
i do not want them here overnight
rick rick help me

i was dreaming about you how beautiful you were
you were not dreaming about me
then i was not beautiful
you were you *are* it was fantastic
they want to replace me the board of trustees wants to *replace* me
they just want you to hire some new help
he will need clothes some money
let him try to *make* some money that is part of seeing the world is not it
oh just stop it you knew this was going to happen he is a young man
he is still a boyout in the world he is still a boy
he is a goddamn psychiatristof *course* he wants to help he would be happy if he could help *commit* me
you *invented* him you have completely made his up
wilbur he picked them for us himself
i suppose it would not hurt to *meet* him that is his name again
dr homer wells
he *sniffs* that ether i have seen him do it
it is because he is too tired to sleep he has to
he *smells* like he could put you to sleep
he is a doctor busterdoctors smell like ether
*you are* a doctor homeryou do not smell like ether
i am *not* a doctor i have not been to medical schooli have not even been to high school
but you have studied with the old man for *years*
i am *not* a doctor
i mean your parents
i know who you mean i think about leaving here but not to find *them*
yeah but sometimes i wish i could meet mine anyway
what for buster what would you do if you met them
uh i would like to show them that i can cook a little
you cook very well
and that i can drive a truck
better than i can
homer you know i would never kill anyoneyou know i would not
i think mary agnes could kill someone
that is she so emotional about
what would she die of
what are you going to tell the little ones
i will tell them fuzzy was adopted
why would the little ones believe that *anyone* would adopt him
they will believe it because they want to believe it
should not we tell homer
daddy it is a letter to *me*
he mentions homer too you know
it is getting late i think i will pack it in
how about him not needing the frigging compass how about that
good night kids do not catch cold it is getting cold already
so mrs
is your family in the apple business too
no but i work therei like it my dad's a lobsterman
i know
he is going to be dropping bombs on mandalay they are going to be shooting at him
i cannot have a baby alone i do not even know if he is coming back
i guess i will see you around the orchards thanks for everything
so not bored yet
i better go
a movie *outside*
yes but it is closed all the time now because of the blackout
people watched the movies in their cars
when they watched at all do you like movies
you have seen only one movie which one
but you looked as if you liked it
first she loved him then she did not then no one else could have him
and what did she die of exactly
she was torn apart she died of a broken heart
that is the *medical* explanation
you are a natural you were born to drive a car like this
the screen is enormous imagine king kong up *there* have you seen a lot of movies here
at least you were never lonely
you do not miss it
i miss things i miss people  i miss reading to the boys
but you had so much *responsibility*
i never *asked* for any responsibility
privacy is exactly the point of drive in movies
sometimes movies mostly bore wally
ahha  so what is thata radio
how could you not *care* about the movie
you just cuddle you come to hug to kiss you do not *come* here to watch the movie
that is what *i would* come here for i would watch the movie
just tell me do you want me to go do you want me to stay
it will be okay
*what* will be okay
olive told me  you might have told me yourself
so we should wait and see for how long
i grew up with wally i began my adult life with him
fine that is all there is to it then
no that is not all there is to it i love you tooi *know* i do
okay okayi know you do too
i told her she does not feel she can do that something about her father not letting her go anywhere
she will not go to st cloud's
well we cannot force her it is her decision
you do not understand it is her father
mr rose *knows*
wait *wait* are you sure
is not that like waiting and seeing
no nothing is nothing i want wally to come home i am afraid to see him too
i know  is *that* nothing
stop it just cut it out
you got up you *did* something if you keep this up you might be in danger of making a *decision*
i know i am sorry
he is *paralyzed*
he is *alive* he still loves you  so do i
please do not make me say it again
please that is enough i *loved* you tooyou know i did
did well okay
please do not
and now that wally's coming back and because he will certainly *need* you
do you think she will be all right
i know you do not think much of being needed or of me for that matter
i am sorry for what i said about wally needing you it was unnecessary
no i am the one who should be sorry you have every right to be angry
how is that wally doing
i have got some more clothes for you i just keep forgetting to bring them with me
you ai not been through what i been through candy
i know where you can go homer and i can take you
you can trust me is it jack it is not jack is it it is *muddy* is it muddy
so many children are they all orphans
wally thinks apples are boring
i never said they were boring
you said apples are not exactly flying
there you said it was boring
i love you wally
i was just showing homer the orchards kind of a geography lesson
you have been giving him a *flying* lesson
he thinks people *like* to get whacked by branches
i thought they might take me
they wanted a girl
you are one of the best curlywe could not let just anyone take you
dr larch would not let just anyone take *any* of us
that is true
nobody's asked for me have they
nobody special enough curly
you mean somebody asked
her temperature is a hundred and four
homer wells born portland maine march 2 1915
homer was born *here* in what was it 1922
you mean they will replace you with someone who will not perform abortions
so here is my candidate what do you think
or that he cannot be bothered to write us a proper letter a dissertation on apples we do not need
he probably does not make much money picking appleshe must have had to pay to send them too
i just wanted to ask you
edna come dance with me let's be foolish tonight
is *your* father dead
cirrhosisit is a disease of the liver
*liver* killed him
*alcohol* killed himhe drank himself to death
but did you know him
barely it hardly mattered that i knew him
did you know your mother better
she is dead now too she was a nanny
that is a nanny do
she looks after other people's children
did you grow up around here
no she was an immigrant
that is an immigrant
homer does not king kong think the woman is his *mother*
uh surethat is what kong thinks all right
uh it is the end of october
do not get too excited fuzzy
did you bite it
i do not remember
it looks like you bit itit will be all right
maybe i was kissing someone and he bit me
no you did it yourself maybe in your sleep
i am sorry they are not used to seeing a car like this
so now uh you are not i mean do *you* do the
no dr larch will be performing the procedure
what kind of plane are you flying
