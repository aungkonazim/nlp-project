okay then how about we try out some french cuisine  saturday  night
forget it
let me see what i can do
right  see  you are ready for the quiz
forget french
well there's someone i think might be 
you are sweet
eber's deep conditioner every two days and i never ever use a blowdryer without the diffuser attachment
i really really really wanna go but i cannot  not unless my sister goes
i am working on it but she does not seem to be going for him
who knows  all i have ever heard her say is that she would dip before dating a guy that smokes
i believe we share an art instructor
i was
you never wanted to go out with 'me did you
then that is all you had to say
what crap
me  this endless blonde babble i am like boring myself
thank god  if i had to hear one more story about your coiffure
what good stuff
the real you
like my fear of wearing pastels
i hope so
they do not
combination  i do not know  i thought he would be different  more of a gentleman
i do not have to be home until two
i did
it is a gay cruise line but i will be like wearing a uniform and stuff
hi joey
you are concentrating awfully hard considering it is gym class
you know the deal  i can ' t go if kat does not go 
nowhere hi daddy
can you at least start wearing a bra
it means that gigglepuss is playing at club skunk and we are going
i think you are a freak  i think you do this to torture me  and i think you suck
that is normal
bogey lowensteings party is normal but you are too busy listening to bitches who need prozac to know that
at least i am not a clouted fen sucked hedgepig
it is shakespeare  maybe you have heard of him
can we go now
i really do not think i need any social advice from you right now
like you care
but you hate joey
now i do  back then was a different story
as in
you did what
i wanted to let you make up your own mind about him
i am not stupid enough to repeat your mistakes
i guess i thought i was protecting you
i guess i will never know will i
so did you
you set me up
i just wanted 
what to completely damage me  to send me to therapy forever what
no i just wanted
it is just you
no you are not dating until your sister starts dating  end of discussion
what if she never starts dating
then neither will you  and i will get to sleep at night
but it is not fair  she is a mutant daddy
exactly my point
and where are you going
if you must know we were attempting to go to a small study group of friends
otherwise known as an orgy
if kat's not going you are not going
it is just a party daddy
daddy no
just for a minute
the prom  kat has a date
no but
it is that hot rod joey right that ' s who you want me to bend my rules for
he is not a hot rod  whatever that is
you are not going unless your sister goes  end of story
i have a date daddy  and he ' s not a captain of oppression like some men we know
did not have you pegged for a gigglepuss fan  are not they a little too preteen bellybutton ring for you
fan of a fan  you see a couple of minors come in
just sent 'em through
so they tell me
c'mon  i am supposed to give you the tour
north actually  how would you   
i was kidding people actually live there
yeah  a couple  we are outnumbered by the cows though
how many people were in your old school
how many people go here
couple thousand most of them evil
yeah but these guys have never seen a horse  they just jack off to clint eastwood
you burn you pine you perish
who is she
bianca stratford  sophomore do not even think about it
why not
sure do  my mom's from canada
guess who just signed up for a tutor
you mean i would get a chance to talk to her
you could consecrate with her my friend
that is her  bianca's sister
the mewling rampalian wretch herself
unlikely but even so she still cannot go out with you  so that is the point
you wanna go out with him
he seems like he thrives on danger
did she actually say she would go out with you
that is what i just said
hey  i have gotta have a few clients when i get to wall street
in that case we will need to make it a schoolwide blow out
will bogey get bent
are you kidding  he will piss himself with joy  he is the ultimate kiss ass
it is a lung cancer issue
her favorite uncle
dead at fortyone
okay  i was not sure
it is her favorite band
hell i have just been going over the whole thing in my head and 
no i ' m not
best case scenario you are back on the payroll for awhile
yeah  we will see
i have retrieved certain pieces of information on miss katarina stratford i think you will find helpful
do not make me do it man
it is off the whole thing
she is partial to joey not me
i don ' t know  i decided not to nail her when she was too drunk to remember it
she just needs time to cool off i will give it a day
she kissed me
you get the girl
yeah and i noticed the only part of you featured in your big kmart spread was your elbow  tough break
they are running the rest of me next month
not at all
and why would i do that
yeah whatever  i want you to go out with her
sure sparky  i will get right on it
you just said
you need money to take a girl out
but you would go out with her if you had the cake
you are gonna pay me to take out some girl
fine thirty
fifty and you have got your man
i am on it
watching the bitch trash my car does not count as a date
i got her under control she just acts crazed in public to keep up the image
forget it
forget her sister then
a deal's a deal
do what
get her to act like a human
enough with the barbie ng ken shit i know
nope  just came by to chat
we do not chat
well actually i thought i would run an idea by you  you know just to see if you are interested
we are not
uh  yeah  we are old friend*
you and verona
what  we took bathes together when we were kids
hey  it is all for the higher good right
patrick verona   random skid
that is pat verona the one who was gone for a year i heard he was doing porn movies
i am sure he is completely incapable of doing anything that interesting
he always look so
block e
just a little
an attempted slit
you could always go with me  i am sure william has some friends
william did not even go to high school
that is never been proven
neither has his heterosexuality
does it matter
if i was bianca it would be any school you want precious  do not forget your tiara
no fear
who cares
i did not have a choice
you did not have a choice  where is kat and what have you done with her
i did bianca a favor and it backfired
you did not
i got drunk  i puked  i got rejected it was big fun
well i guess we are not since we do not have dates 
listen to you  you sound like betty all pissed off because archie is taking veronica
okay okay we will not go  it is not like i have a dress anyway
you ' re looking at this from the wrong perspective  we are making a statement
oh good  something new and different for us
oh honey  tell me we have not' progressed to fullon hallucinations
sweating like a pig actually  and yourself
there's a way to get a guy's attention
my mission in life
oh right  friday
like where  the 7eleven on burnside do you even know my name screwboy
i know a lot more than that
i do not really think you warrant that strong an emotion
then say you will spend dollar night at the track with me
and why would i do that
come on  the ponies the flat beer you with money in your eyes me with my hand on your ass
you  covered in my vomit
i was in the laundromat i saw your car thought i would say hi
depends on the topic my fenders do not really whip me into a verbal frenzy
that is what you want is not it
do you mind  you are sort of ruining it for me
you know who the raincoats are
why do not you
i am getting trashed man is not that what you are supposed to do at a party
i say do what you wanna do
funny you are the only one
i just need to lie down for awhile
uh uh you lie down and you will go to sleep
i know just let me sleep
leave it to you to use big words when you are shitfaced
why  are you doing this
i told you
you do not care if i die
sure i do
like you could find one
see that  who needs affection when i have got blind hatred
just let me sit down
you know what they say
but it is gigglepuss  i know you like them  i saw you there
then why would you ask
why would you lie
do what
my father would not approve of that that
you do not strike me as the type that would ask permission
i am getting there
he just wants me to be someone i am not
what are you doing here
i heard there was a poetry reading
you  are so 
do not for one minute think that you had any effect whatsoever on my panties
so what did i have an effect on 
other than my upchuck reflex nothing
look up sunshine
c'mon  it is not that bad
try looking at it from this angle
forget it  i am staying
you want me to climb up and show you how to get down
i figured it had to be something ridiculous to win your respect  and piss you off
good call
so how would you get chapin to look the other way
i dazzled him with my wit
yeah well do not let it get out
so that is your excuse
acting the way we do
something like that
then you screwed up
i hate peas
no  something real  something no one else knows
you are sweet  and sexy  and completely hot for me
you are amazingly selfassured has anyone ever told you that
go to the prom with me
you know what i mean
no i will not go with you
why not
because i do not want to it is a stupid tradition
so i have to have a motive to be with you
you tell me
you need therapy  has anyone ever told you that
answer the question patrick
nothing  there's nothing in it for me just the pleasure of your company
it is scurvy's  his date got convicted where would you get the dress
it is just something i had  you know
oh huh
look i am   sorry  that i questioned your motives  i was wrong
it gets worse  you still have your freshman yearbook
you were paid to take me out  by  the one person i truly hate  i knew it was a setup
it was not like that
really  what was it like  a down payment now then a bonus for sleeping with me
i did not care about the money
i thought you could use it when you start your band
is that right
yeah but then i fucked up i fell for her
because i like to torture you
oh bianca  can you get me my freshman yearbook
don ' t you even dare  
i thought we decided you were going to school here  at u of 0
you decided
then tell them i had a seizure
is this about sarah lawrence you punishing me
i thought you were punishing me
why cannot we agree on this
because you are making decisions for me
as a parent that is my right
so what i want does not matter
yeah  she left with some bikers big ones  full of sperm
no daddy
so tell me about this dance was it fun
parts of it
which parts
the part where bianca beat the hell out of some guy
bianca did what
that is the matter  upset that i rubbed off on her
no  impressed
oh christ  do not tell me you have changed your mind  i already sent 'em a check
expressing my opinion is not a terrorist action
the point is kat  people perceive you as somewhat 
just smack her now
yeah  i guess
oh yeah
the situation is my man cameron here has a major jones for bianca stratford
what is it with this chick  she have three tits
dorsey can plow whoever he wants i am just in this for the cash
so dorsey can get the girl
we are your guys
just for now
i am liking you guys better
no  i have got a sweetpaying job that i am about to lose
sweet love renew thy force
man  do not say shit like that to  me people can hear you
it says here you exposed yourself to a group of freshmen girls
it was a bratwurst  i was eating lunch
with the teeth of your zipper
touch of the flu
i am at a loss then  what should we talk about your year of absence
that is to discuss
see you next week
make anyone cry today
sarah lawrence is on the other side of the country
pirate  no question
dr ruth
but  who  what 
your daughters went to the prom
did i have anything to say about it
absolutely not
that ' s what i thought
the water's going putrid in the barrels
you will be drinking your own piss for the glory of spain and admiral colon  bastard
ah leave him alone  he is doing no harm
with a face like that  i do not want you looking at me  you hear
we will all go crazy
we left three weeks ago alonso cannot be that near
yes your eminence  the voyage should not take more than six or seven weeks
unfortunately don colon that is precisely where our opinions differ  are you familiar with the work of aristotle  erathostene  ptolemeus
i am your eminence
if they agree to follow me yes
blind faith is what i consider heresy
the judgment is ours
on the contrary your eminence  it seems to me the man is preparing his own cross
what a tragedy what a waste of a life
i know
i have not given you much of a life
well that is true  i have a child by a man who will not marry me  who's always leaving
are we going to argue
i would love to argue with you sometimes  but you are never here
i find that hard to believe
thank god
i do not want you to wait for me
that is something you cannot decide
you do not usually ask
i can arrange for the queen to take fernando and diego into her service
they tried but i did not let them
i am busy inside
forgive me don bobadilla  those positions have already been taken
may i ask by whom
bartolome and giacomo colon
yes i remember
appointment to what
viceroy of the west indies
congratulations  then i am free to search for the mainland
i am afraid this is not the worst news
there will be a time
you promise  do you swear on st christopher
yes yes i do on all of them
this time with me
not bad
i am not listening father  but i cannot help hearing
he asks when he can come to visit you  he left his address
he never had one except aboard my ships
really  god i would not know where to start and yet
tell me the first thing that comes to your mind
i am not bargaining
then you are too ambitious
 for a commoner
don bobadilla is already a judge my dear don cristobal
good  we are also in need of judges  except there are no thieves
what  do i have so many already
to rise so high in so short a time is a dangerous occupation  a little hypocrisy goes a long way
call them
look out of that window
roofs towers palaces spires
all of them created by people like me
what is it  a tribe  an island
island  far
tell the chief we thank him
chief knows
tell him his country is very beautiful  tell him we are leaving men here  to build a fort
chief says  he has a god
 and also to bring medicine
chief says
he has medicine  tell him we admire his people
he understands
ask him if he will help
you did the same to your god
you never learned how to speak my language
that is what it says
how did you manage it
with some difficulty  i had to promise them you were not a total fool
to open a new route to asia  at the moment there are only two ways of reaching it
ignorance  i believe the indies are no more than 750 leagues west of the canary islands
how can you be so certain
the calculations of toscanelli marin de tyr esdras
esdras is a jew
so was christ
i will try to remember that marchena
father marchena
passion is something one cannot control
you get so carried away when you are being contradicted
i have been contradicted all my life eternity
only god knows the meaning of such words my son
wait  i have waited seven years already  how much longer do you want me to wait
if god intends you to go then you will go
damn god
colon  do not
forgive me father  for i have sinned
father i have betrayed my family i betrayed my men  and i betrayed you
what are you saying
i lied  the journey will be longer than i said
how long
i am not sure it could be twice the distance
if i tell them they will not follow me  you know that i am right father  you trust me
give me absolution
you will always be older than me father
i knew you would
new worlds create new people
oh  so you are a new man
what did they say about granada before today
that she was impregnable
surely you can do anything you want
you show no inclination to speak otherwise
thirty seven your majesty and you
they come and go as naked as the day god created them
there is one thing i would like to understand why do you want to go back after all this
if you want to keep your head on your shoulders you will do as i say
we do not need to know
my horse does not work
you did not hear me don colon  not my horse
god be with us admiral
well i surely know what a quadrant is  but i have never seen it used at night before
come over here
twenty eight
he is drawing an isthmus he is saying we are on an isthmus
we cannot be
six days ago yes
you must be mad
we have to keep the hopes of these men alive
we are on the verge of a mutiny colon

we are lost
the land is there  i know it
jesus maria  i should have never listened to you
you never did  you did all the talking for both of us remember
you bloody
pinzon pinzon all we can do now is go forward  think about that
you tell that to them
you are right  let the men decide
yes your majesty
never your majesty  although
yes  it would be a pity would not it  call him back
is this true brother buyl
he must be replaced

'cause eddie woulda locked him up by now
but you knew that right
he knew all along
you hear that question garcia
are not you tired
if i go home i will not be able to fall asleep anyway
it hurts  aw jesus
lay down  stay down bobby
not good
what the hell happened
they were inside  they booby trapped her apartment
capra  that is not czech or russian who said he sounded russian
the clerk
look you cannot shoot him in cold blood
yes  my psychiatrist did not insist that i stay on my medication
so you feel absolutely no responsibility for killing these people
and is not there a movie in the works about you
we are in negotiations that is correct
but does not the son of sam law prevent criminals from profiting from their crimes
well how nice to see you again elena you are looking wonderful
right just a sec
sure what is it
well it is nothing really important but it is annoying
that is up
it is about my salary cheques
well what do you think we ought to do about it
i do not think we should make any fuss about it yet i am sure they will straighten it out
i must say i never did understand why they split us into two groups for training
no i never did either
i suppose so though of course there's a more sinister explanation
no as a matter of fact i did not
that seems very unlikely
yes i thought so
of course it would be very easy for us to find out now
that is true
i know it would be almost inconceivable
but not completely inconceivable
i suppose it is not logically impossible
i guess it is not
still all we have to do is ask hal
yes i do not know what to make of it
i suppose computers have been known to be wrong
yes but it is more likely that the tolerances on our testing gear are too low
anyway it is just as well that we replace it better safe than sorry
are you reasonably awake
oh i am fine i am wide awake that is up
well hal's reported the aounit about to fail again
you are kidding
two units in four days how many spares do we have
two more
well i hope there's nothing wrong with the assembly on those other wise we are out of business
i guess you do not know your own strength old boy
i guess not
i think i will have to go out and burn them off
what is it hal
my fpc shows an impending failure of the antenna orientation unit
i understand hal we will take care of it please let me have the hard copy
sure dave that is up
you know that we checked the two aounits that you reported in imminent failure condition
yes i know
you probably also know that we found them okay
yes i know that but i can assure you that they were about to fail
hal is there anything bothering you  anything that might account for this problem
well do not worry about it
and do not you worry about it
is your confidence in me fully restored
yes it is hal
well that is a relief you know i have the greatest enthusiasm possible for the mission
yes it is
i suppose you are pretty broken up about it
repairing the antenna is a pretty dangerous operation
look dave your have probably got a lot to do i suggest you leave it to me
hal switch to manual hibernation control
i am fine daddy when are you coming home
yes i know that sweetheart
are you coming to my party
no i am sorry darling i told you i will not be home for a few days
when are you coming home

'bye 'bye now sweetheart
goodbye daddy
thank you
well how is it going back there
i suppose it was bound to happen sooner or later
berkeley told me that they think it came from contamination on a returning mars flight
i will bet it is a fortune
oh she is growing up very fast as a matter of fact she is six tomorrow
oh that is such a delightful age
how is gregor
well that does sound very odd

by the deformation between the mother rock and the fill

there's nothing like weightless sleep for a complete rest
when do we arrive at clavius
we are scheduled to dock in about seven hours is there anything we can do for you
oh no thank you the two girls have taken wonderful care of me i am just fine
incidentally dr floyd i wonder if i can have a word with you about the security arrangements
what do you mean
i take it this is something to do with the trouble they are having up at clavius

his passing has left me with something of a dilemma  a terrible terrible dilemma
i will do whatever i can to help
i wear a gun when i can tell a client expects me to  other than that there's never any reason
just curious
cash stock certificates and this
i am afraid i do not
of course  but i am certain it is nothing to worry about
i told you i cannot not yet
you do not have any other choice
you have found missing persons before
nothing remotely like this
i am not positive this means anything
the checks were for odd amounts
totalled together these five checks from five different accounts they equal one million dollars
you are joking
to the penny  exactly one million dollars in cash
do you think the film could have cost that much
you are one hell of a detective mrs christian
how are you  having any luck
i do not know if luck's the word are you feeling alright
i have been ordered into bed  the doctor says i have gotten the flu or some other wretched ailment
i hope it is nothing serious

if you have a pencil and paper i will tell you how to send it
neil neil cole
right agent cole told me he would call and let you know to expect me  he did not call

do you think the police did a good job
i do not know  i think so
will you let me look
my husband never laid a hand on her she would have told me she would have told me
it is been six years

they brought her into the room one man he put a knife to her throat and he raped her

and so is your baby  you have got more than just yourself to think of now
that is the only reason you are alive

i want to talk about the baby
all of us  right
two hours a day six days a week
stick around please
he invited me to his house last night
it was supposed to be  dad had a heart attack two days ago
how is he  
it was moderate  he will be all right  but it was out of the question his coming along
and they thought uyouu could re place the skipper
your 'out'  this came for you 
my father  he is not  
dead  matter of fact he is much better he is left the hospital
that may be  but dad stays where uheu is and i am staying here
you are really a mixedup oddball are not you
thenthis is a 'flying saucer'
but if they udou
i do not know
helen  i appeal to you 
what could be worse than disappoint ing a little girl
disappointing a ubigu girl
i guess
'his' side  i have seen it all right a nice bright yellow
skipper  look at the depth gauge
not ualoneu you are not
go back and tell dr neilsen have him report to the skipper
you know  it uisu
let's get back to work and maybe we uwillu be soon
the sound again
somewhere down there
wonder where powell and carney are
we will have to look for them later
oh it does
right skipper
seems to be all around
what about down
ido not know
speedabout twentytwo knots coursedue north
right at our oneeyed friend
the frogmen
with their underwater experience they will be invaluable  take sidearms and flare pistols 
sidearms  but the saucer's dead
we hope
yes griff
all internal repairs completed and frogmen report exterior damage minor
something wrong
the inertial navigation system must have been knocked out in the crash
why do you say that
we are dead in the water  but it indicates we are moving
radiation levelconstantly rising
under uwateru
highintensity arcs will burn submerged  and millions of voltsdischarged in random directions
suppose our theorizing is correct then this ucouldu be the next danger point
what if the tiger shark were to anticipate a bit  perhaps be lying there waiting  
if we were lucky enough to catch him with his power depleted
what direction does the system indicate
there's got to be an explanation
there is  i believe our friendcyclops is returning to life
as ready as we ucanu be  i will report to the skipper
who with
dr neilsen  he will be  
i think i should have joined the air force
after torpedo room  report
take a look
thirtyfour seconds
that is what i said
but  what can we accomplish
we can uramu him
nothing we can do now
minus three
come where
point of view is everything to us uyouru form of life is ugly as we appear to you
tell me something  why can uiu hear you when the others could not
 for horrors like yourself
i am afraid not  therefore 
on the contrary  i want you  unharmed  perfect
that is why no water leaked inside when we rammed you
of course  but it is time to be gin the return voyage 
thank you
i will be another
or perhaps until he gets us
but uanswersu are what we need  not more questions
toward the pole

i think your first response to the twombley shooting was the correct one
which is
that it was not an accident
then who shot him
well your friend i think jack hewitt
motive you gotta have a motive
they would not deal with a guy like jack who else benefits if twombley is suddenly dead
i do not know you tell me
a hunting accident is perfect
right's right goddamnit do not you care that is right
i care about what happened the truth i am a student of history remember
of course it happened why would i lie about it
it may have happened but not the way you said

it was the experience of a lifetime
how bout a hug for the old man
been better dad you
it is okay honey i got you i got you you are okay
okay i am slowing us down
did we warn them off
yes they refused to alter course and the 747 would not answer our hails
they are in our airspace we would be within our rights
the world would not look on us kindly if we shot down a civilian airliner
warn then again if they do not respond shoot them down we will not be intimidated
got it
pop it open there should be a red switch toggle it up
okay it is on we have got some indicator lights here
cross it  the static overwhelms the voice then cuts out
copy air force one welcome to the party
you read my mind
put your pilot on
he is busy being dead
i am doing what i can
okay we are gonna arc a fat one to the right got it
got it
stay cool
we still got three migs running around and six more on the way
just stay on my wing sir i will take you all the way in
no we are losing fuel and my rudder's not responding
lemme take a look
sluggish i think it is jammed too
uh tower we got a problem up here
we do not know that
holding the president hostage is not something that slips your mind when you are making demands
that kid's name was jim marshall
this does not make sense
i prefered the terrorists
that is game set and match there's nothing to do except call the chief justice
thanks  wrote it last night
an exercise in futility send the nimitz back in
does your office have anything to add mr dean
we have got four hours before they make it into turkienistan airspace
iraqi's will not buy it either they are already in on this or they will think we are spying
if fired upon tell our fighters that they are ordered to engage
to swear you in as president
yes mr president
you are duty to what the country you served does not exist anymore
my loyalty was never to my country
about goddamn time
please change course to zero seven four and drop to eighteen thousand feet over
air force one acknowledged  tnt emergency parachute launch ramp
ga get it
sir this plane carries the president of the united states
we checked the manifest everyone was accounted for
a secret service agent it must be
why did they do that
psychology they are trying to unnerve us
well it worked
we are not going to make it
not even close hell we cannot even make syria or iraq
where are we now
over the black sea i can probably get us to turkey or georgia
romeo tango zulu copy one the television graphics of the first family against the presidential seal

rose i do not have time for this
how do you know she understands you have not spent more than five minutes with her or me in weeks
but that is the point jim we are right here
i wish it were that easy
i should trust that promise because you know the voters are still waiting for that middle class tax cut

they are still alive but the loyalists plan to start killing hostages in forty minutes
then tell me there's a rescue operation underway
you know my policy we do not negotiate with terrorists if we start now all of america becomes a target
but this is different sir you are the president

sergeant detective  i was not aware there were any newcomers at the rank of detective yet
you were partners with him on some slag  uh newcomer real estate thing
no sergeant  not history  eternity
this is becoming a serious breach of security
he did not recognize me
it is his new partner that i am worried about
gesundheit  you do not mind if i stick to george do you
his body was discovered three days ago in an alley off of central avenue near downtown
with two bri sabot slugs in the chest
through the chest  rupturing both the primary and secondary hearts
nice signal dickwad
there was no wallet but he was still wearing a watch and two rings
great  well i am sure glad that is settled are not you

todd watson  the assistant manager

how potent
we all did
where did he get it  was there any of it on the ship
i must trust you matthew  i cannot stop this without you

why  that is the big goddamn deal
there  go back  down that side street
do what  george 
 it is harcourt
harcourt is dead

amanda ripleymcclaren  married name i guess  age  sixtysix at time of death  two years ago  i am sorry

i suggest you study the disks ripley has been kind enough to prepare for you
uhhunh  one of thirty or so all over the planet  they are completely automated  we manufacture them by the way
yeah  maybe the organisms like the heat that is why they built
why not
this is clearly an important species we are dealing with here we cannot just arbitrarily exterminate them 
do not make me pull rank ripley
what rank  i believe corporal hicks has authority here
corporal hicks
this operation is under military jurisdiction and hicks is next in chain of command  right

thank you madame  come on now  courage play me something you know
it is just a trifle of course
may i try it
you do me too much honour sire
let's have some fun  bring in herr mozart please but slowly slowly i need a minute to practice
finally such an immense joy diletto straordinario
excuse me sire but what do you think these could be being a foreigner i would love to learn
cattivo again court composer well tell him mozart name us a german virtue
your highness
i am thinking about herr mozart what is your view
and the result satisfies
yes of course my concern is to protect you from any suspicion of favouritism
ahha favouritism but i so want mozart
majesty i did believe me it was a most agonizing decision but finally i simply could not recommend herr mozart
why not
of course not
i have to tell you mozart is not entirely to be trusted alone with young ladies
it is not a question of liking your majesty your own law decrees it i am afraid
well look at them
the director of our opera count orsinirosenberg
oh sir yes the honour is mine absolutely
really oh grazie signore sono commosso e un onore per mo eccezionale compositore brilliante e famossissimo
because i have already found the most wonderful libretto
it is actually quite amusing majesty it is set  the  whole thing is set in a  in a 
in a pasha's harem majesty a seraglio
what on one hearing only
i think so sire yes
yes indeed
and german
oh yes absolutely german unquestionably
so then you like it you really like it your majesty

enchanted madame
well  well we have not quite received my father's consent your majesty not entirely not altogether
thank you sire
what is it
yes sire
yet we hear you are making an opera from it is this true
who told you this majesty
it is not your place to ask questions is it true
well yes i admit it is
would you tell me why
well majesty it is only a comedy
ah love again
guess guess majesty imagine the longest time such a thing could last then double it
well six or seven minutes maybe eight
twenty sire how about twenty twenty minutes of continuous music no recitatives
you are passionate mozart but you do not persuade
sire the whole opera is finished do you know how much work went into it
in my opinion it is time we had a piece in our own language sir plain german for plain people
well there it is
your majesty herr mozart 
yes what about him
he is here
ahha well there it is good
am i not welcome
of course welcome welcome ten thousand times papa my papa

i suppose so he sits there all he time doing some silly opera
opera opera
please do not ask me to go back again i am frightened i am very very frightened
are you sure it is an opera
that is right
papa the rule is you can only give penalties that can be performed in the room
that kind of music should be punishable by death
yes well it is all good fun
i liked the horse
what is this
put it down i said it is nothing for you
oh i am sorry i am sorry what have you got for me is it finished
because there's nothing to see
well we can
so let me see it where is it
what haha that is funny  i like it which one eh you are a funny fellow  hannah come this way
of course it is him who do you think it is
strudel this is herr mozart say good morning
well yes on the whole i suppose  how long have you been playing fraulein
is my pupil still anxious to learn the art of music
well your pupil is married and living in mannheim young man
really perhaps your dear wife might care to profit from my instruction
what is this mozart that is the matter with you
well since it appears nobody is eager to hire my services could you favour me with a little money instead
what for
if a man cannot earn he must borrow
well this is hardly the way to go about it
please i will give it back i promise please sir
my answer is no mozart
ah love well of course in italy we know nothing about that
but this is absurd
did you like it then
how could i not
it really is the best music one can hear in vienna today do not you agree
so you see this post is very important to me right now
i have just come from the palace the post has been filled
whom did they choose
herr sommer
sommer herr sommer but the mangs a fool he is a total mediocrity
no no no he has yet to achieve mediocrity
you do not mean to tell me you are living in poverty
no but i am broke i am always broke i do not know why
it has been said my friend that you are inclined to live somewhat above your means
how can anyone say that we have no cook no maid we have no footman nothing at all
how is that possible you give concerts do not you i hear they are quite successful
do you have a daughter
i am afraid not
i would better not it is a bit of a secret
come come mozart i am interested truly
actually it is a big secret oh this is delicious what is it
cream cheese mixed with granulated sugar and suffused with rum crema al mascarpone
ah italian
forgive me we all have patriotic feelings of some kind
two thousand two hundred florins is all i need a hundred fifty
what exactly are you working on
i cannot say really
it is unbelievable the director has actually ripped out a huge section of my music pages of it
really why
oh no my wife took it out in time
how fortunate
it is not fair that a man like that has power over our work
but there are those who have power over him i think i will take this up with the emperor
oh excellency would you
with all my heart mozart
thank you oh thank you
i think it is marvelous truly
it is the best opera yet written i know it why did not they come
grazie mio caro wolfgang
grazie a lei signor antonio
how could i not
did my work please you
how could it not excellency
you flatter me
oh no one hears such sounds and what can one say but  salieri
what work
a mass for the dead
what dead who is dead
a man who deserved a requiem mass and never got one
who are you
i am only a messenger do you accept you will be paid well
how much
work fast and be sure to tell no one what you do you will see me again soon
are you neglecting my request
no no i promise you i will give you a wonderful piece  the best i ever can
i am taking you home you are not well

not here she is not well either she went to the spa
you mean she is not coming back
you are so good to me truly thank you

i mean to come to my opera you are the only colleague who did
this is only a vaudeville
i do
i have bad fancies i do not sleep well anymore then i drink too much and think stupid things
are you ill
the doctor thinks i am but 
no no it is him
what man
he knows he knows
yes can i  could i help you in any way
would you actually you could
my dear friend it would be my greatest pleasure
but you would have to swear not to tell a soul i am not allowed
of course
a mass a mass for the dead
the end of the recordare  statuens in parte dextra
so now the confutatis confutatis maledictis when the wicked are confounded flammis acribus addictis how would you translate that
consigned to flames of woe
do you believe in it
oh yes
we ended in f major
what time
common time
sing it back
first bassoon and tenor trombone  what
with the tenors
also identical
exactly the instruments to go with the voices trumpets and timpani tonic and dominant
oh no now for the fire  strings in unison  ostinato on all  like this
i think so
show me
sopranos up to f on the second 'voca'
yes and on  wouldictis'
you go fast
do you have it
oh no i am not tired at all
we will stop for just a moment then we will do the lacrimosa
i can keep going i assure you shall we try
would you stay with me while i sleep a little
i am not leaving you
i am so ashamed
what for
i was foolish i thought you did not care for my work  or me forgive me forgive me
well not especially it can be in turkish if you really want i do not care
but your majesty 
just let me tell you how it begins
certainly herr director
yes but this is not a ballet this is a dance at figaro's wedding
exactly a dance
but surely the emperor did not mean to prohibit dancing when it is part of the story
it is dangerous for you to interpret his majesty's edicts give me your score please
taking out what you should never have put in
oh yes certainly certainly herr director
what is what
why do i have to submit samples of my work to some stupid committee just to teach a sixteenyearold girl
because his majesty wishes it
is the emperor angry with me
on the contrary
then why does not he simply appoint me to the post
mozart you are not the only composer in vienna
no but i am the best
a little modesty would suit you better
who is on this committee
kapellmeister bonno count orsini rosenberg and court composer salieri
naturally the italians of course always the italians
may i just do that majesty show you how it begins just that
oh german german please let it be german
i am father vogler i am a chaplain here i thought you might like to talk to someone
about what
you tried to take your life you do remember that do not you
what do you want
do you understand that you have sinned gravely
leave me alone
i cannot leave alone a soul in pain
do you know who i am you never heard of me did you
that makes no difference all men are equal in god's eyes
are they
offer me your confession i can offer you god's forgiveness
i do not seek forgiveness
i know a little i studied it in my youth
then you must know this
i did not that was mozart wolfgang amadeus mozart you know who that is
of course the man you accuse yourself of killing
ah  you have heard that
all vienna has heard that
and do they believe it
is it true
do you believe it
should i
he was murdered father mozart cruelly murdered
every day sometimes for hours i would pray
no was mozart a good man
oh i thought you did so every day so speak now answer me
i do not claim to unravel the mysteries i treasure them as you should
i did
no you did not
i poisoned his life
but not his body
what difference does that make
my son why should you want all vienna to believe you a murderer is that your penance is it
i have seen the manuscript
about the ballet
ballet what ballet
excuse me  did not his majesty specifically forbid ballet in his opera
yes absolutely is there a ballet in figaro
yes in the third act
well done sire
did we
for the same reason herr chamberlain that it was banned in france
oh yes yes and that was
what who the devil are you
i have taken pity on you my angel i heard your wish
oh well thank you how wonderful some people get all the luck
well promise then
what do you mean  now
of course now right away before i get any older
who is she
she did not say but she says it is urgent
excuse me my dear
show her in then go to bed
yes i am looking after him
can we come in
well he is sleeping now better not
but he is all right
oh yes he is just exhausted he became dizzy that is all we should let him rest
well tell him we were here will not you
of course
and say everything went wonderfully a triumphdeluxe  say that tell him the audience shouted his name a hundred times
yes  and congratulations to all of you it was superb
yes indeed goodnight to you all now it was perfection  truly
the american yes duck
how did he look
what do you mean 'how did he look'
you know did he seem depressed do you think he will eat the food
miss gallagher surely you must perform some function here at the hospital
dr hirsch
go about your duties
yes doctor
yes doctor
what exactly did he call out
he said 'jack'
that would be jack goodman the boy who was killed
what happened to them
yes i believe he did
come to my office miss price
it is a full moon where is he
at my flat i am off at midnight and
alex has david persisted in his werewolf fantasies
well yes but he seems to be more upset by the death of his friend
has his friend appeared to him again
david says jack comes to warn him
warn him
dr hirsch that is wrong is this more serious than i know
no he knows no one in london besides me i should not have left him alone
let's call the police and see if they can help us find our wandering boy
is he all right why did not you call me where was he
he does not remember he woke up at the zoo
the zoo is he rational
yes he is he is very excited and confused but he is not crazy if that is what you mean
have you read the papers today have you listened to the radio or television
no why
is david acting strangely
no not really
yes i should think so
you are certain he is lucid you will not need any help
he is fine we will come right over
shall i send a car
no a cab will be faster
i expect you shortly
tea would be nice
i beg your pardon
it was a wolf
i am not very hungry thank you
i am afraid you have to eat something
please really i am not hungry
you put me in an awkward position mr kessler
how is that
call me alex
aw come on alex
shall i be forced to feed you mr kessler
shall i be forced to feed you david
this is absurd i am not hungry i do not want any food
will you give me a break
i thought you were asleep
i was what are you reading
'a connecticut yankee in king arthur's court' by mark twain
do you like it
i have just started it my friend gave it to me
i dream of death mostly
i am sorry i should not have asked you
it is okay i want to talk to you
that is not really a very proper question
how old are you
i know
now what do you want to talk about
was jack goodman your good friend
my best friend my very best friend
shall i read to you
what oh yes please
i am sorry i woke you up
do not be silly can i get you something
no thank you just keep me company for a while
that is easy enough
i keep having these really terrible dreams they are getting worse and i cannot seem to stop them
david your dreams will stop you will leave england and your bad memories and then this will all fade away
will you come with me
now david i said i would keep you company but i meant right here and now
will you think about it
how did we get from your bad dreams to my taking a holiday with a patient
not just a patient  me
you are being awfully forward are not you
now i am embarrassed
good i thought for a moment i was the only embarrassed one in the room
a werewolf
i will let you know the next full moon
you are to be discharged tomorrow will you be all right
your dead friend jack
yeah he says that i will become a monster in two days what do you think
i would think so
yeah i would think so too

david perhaps you would like to watch the telly while i take a shower
it is nice to see you
of course
but david
i was not hallucinating

it is silly of you to be apprehensive
werewolves simply do not exist
david do you want me to stay here tonight
yeah i do but go to work
a doper werewolf

dr hirsch will know what to do

i really do not know
of course not david i will fetch in young miss price
oh i do not know i mean look around is not this a fun place
i am sorry northern england first italy later
i think debbie klein is a mediocre person with a good body
debbie is not mediocre and she has one of the great bodies of all time
she is a jerk
you are talking about the woman i love
i am talking about a girl you want to fuck so give me a break
well anyway do you think she will be there
i do not know
i have to make love to her it is very simple she has no choice really
it just fascinates me that you can spend so much energy on someone so dull
it is impossible for a body like that to be dull
we have known debbie what since the eighth grade how many years of foreplay is that
she says she 'likes me too much'
of course the slaughtered lamb why else would they have a severed fox head on a spear as their symbol
that is a wolf's head
of course the slaughtered lamb why else would they have a severed wolf's head on a spear as their symbol
that is not a spear it is a pike
a severed wolf's head on a pike as their symbol
listen at least it is warm in here
look at that
it is a fivepointed star
maybe the owners are from texas
you ask them
you ask them
what do you mean i am starving
apparently so
i do not know let's see if there's an inn or something up the road
beware the moon
come on i am freezing
i have no idea
maybe that pentangle was for something supernatural
i see and they were too embarrassed to talk about it because they felt so silly
i am well aware of how pleasant the weather is in rome at the present time thank you
i heard that
what was it
there are not any coyotes in england
the hound of the baskervilles
pecos bill
no but he was on the moors
it is a full moon 'beware the moong
i do not know come on

a sheep dog or something turn slowly and let's walk away
walk away jack
walking away yes sir here we are walking away
not far enough come on
i will tell you when we get there
well i am glad we whoaa
are you going to help me up

i am aware that i do not look so great but i thought you would be glad to see me
are not you supposed to be buried in new york someplace
yeah your parents came to my funeral i was surprised at how many people came
why should you be surprised you were a very wellliked person
debbie klein cried a lot
i cannot stand it
so you know what she does she is so grief stricken she runs to find solace in rudy levine's bed
rudy levine the shmuck
life mocks me even in death
warn me will you get out of here you meat loaf
i am not listening
on the moors we were attacked by a lycanthrope a werewolf
shut up you zombie
i was murdered an unnatural death and now i walk the earth in limbo until the werewolf's curse is lifted
that is wrong with you shut up
the wolf's bloodline must be severed the last remaining werewolf must be destroyed
will you be quiet
what are you talking about i will not accept this get out god damit
remember what that guy at the slaughtered lamb said 'beware the moon'
stop it jack
beware the moon the full moon david you have got two days

hi david
you do not have to say anything

better pass them over here before something happens to 'em
you stay out of this bob
frankly yes i am feeling a little left out
it is still taking too long the people used to snap to
that was because of the reputation the gang had
as long as people think jesse's still riding we will never get the respect we deserve
cole we are outlaws not exactly the most respectable job if you know what i mean
leave me alone bob
what have you done
i ai not done 
what have you done
swear on jimmy's grave
you are just upset about jesse we all are
he is not bad at it
it is tougher than it looks
i can hit those boys from here we just need a distraction
 will perry 
stop by our spread after that tell our ma we are all right we will go to doc mimms
he just lost his temper a little
the army can hang him
not yet but i am hoping
one false move and i will blow your heads off
you heard me jesse you know how crazy i get
yes i am obviously not standing out in people's minds at the robberies
you are a fine figure of a man
listen jesse we have got a problem  it is cole
he is been full of vinegar lately
he is planning a job
tell me
i think i recognize you
that is going on
i could use the walk
suit yourself we will have some horses waiting for you at the road  let's ride rangers
there's yankees back there lot's of 'em
planting corn harvesting corn year after year
you are not scared are you
pick your fights cousin you taught me that
what is wrong with you
in case we have to kill these sonofabitches i do not want them to see us coming
she got two of them
she was european
all right calm down i will agree sadie was a woman 
after all you did on our farm  you miss it do not you jesse
the war what are you crazy  there are things i miss about it
it was exciting
but it was a whole lot of killing why should we miss that
just like in the war harass their supply lines we kill the railroad's men they will not care
let's ride
i got three
just because he reads all those books and knows all those big words does not make him smart
sure cousin
all the posters and newspapers are calling this bunch the jamesyounger gang
hold on hold on we all know bob is an important part of the gang
what will be
if you would read about it first you would have no problems
what are you saying
a bad idea
i got us through the war all right
and almost got hanged in peacetime
that is it
and i am the better outlaw
then let me run the show general lee
clell tom go get doc mimms in liberty
pass me some whisky
i am out
what we follow you for a year and now that our blood's been spilled you are gonna quit
who's next you me bob
missed you too cousin
pff all we been through the thought never crossed my mind
we did not zerelda did turns out your wife makes a hell of an outlaw
you pay me to find you bluecoats there they are
both would be nice
soon as i hit one the other will know and beat us up
must be a garrison in town we are in occupied territory boys
which one right or left
the brown one
sadie was not a man
shakespeare  he is european
get buckets
they gonna rush us
they are just insurance in case we run
of course  uh sir
this here is the younger gang
all right all right  jesse james never yelled at folk
yeah injun what do you want
great chief of st louis send me
the district marshall
me get heap firewater 
you are right sir
then why cannot i go in there
on account of we are robbing it
oh why did not you just say so
it is a secret
fine i will just wait here
i would appreciate that
what is it
old man tucker is just standing quiet outside the bank
i had you covered  from back there
my little web did that
pff he jumped his horse clear over our heads killed a dozen union soldiers before they knew what hit them
died a hero
go on you are pretty much all healed up
the bullet came out clean but he lost a whole lot of blood praying would not hurt
i fooled them into thinking i was alone
well i hope the boy pulls through we should know in the morning
i think he is already feeling better
so we got a plan
pff they hardly even noticed you
so you are saying i could have done more to attract their attention
you could have worn one of those big floppy womangs easter sunday hats
that would have made an impression
i figure
see that is your problem frank by the time you finish figuring out stuff i am already finished doing it
no jesse your problem is you are always doing stuff before i am finished figuring it out
i reckoned
hell of a war
i am sure it seemed like a good idea at the time
we better go to doc's see that is going on here
you are doing just fine
zee we got to talk to you and your father
what kind of story are they going to believe
maybe maybe
you can shut up now
you are a charmer
i swear i will shoot you in your sleep
next time try fat and haggard
what worries me is that jesus is talking back
heard of him
what do you think
shut up  uh doc i was wondering if uh this evening i could come by
do not care
did not think you would  i am going to go make the coffin
make a thousand of 'em still will not be enough by the time i am through
fine how would it go out here
we are gonna have to talk
and that is why you both lead the gang two of you went into that bank together right
and i do so want to shoot some pinkerton detectives
bob's upset
the posters
bob here will kill a man for sneezing and he is the best shot in the gang
jesse we are outlaws
and we are good at it
it got to you did not it all the killing in the war you need it now
you have killed your fair share of men
if i could go back to farming 
that is a lie you could have bought a dozen farms with the money we have stolen
i cannot quit and leave you alone i cannot quit until you quit ma would have wanted it that way
we are doing this for ma
maybe it started out that way but now
oh yeah
just do me a favor think about what this is costing everybody not just the railroad
no i 
got any ideas little brother
jim was old enough
you are a pisspoor liar for the smartest man i know
i am sure it seemed like a good idea at the time
see you soon oh and i appreciate the distraction back there
hell they hardly even noticed us
yeah jimmy
that he was
they are making him a hero now
saved a lot of folk from the railroad
but he killed a lot of men too
cannot argue that
so what was he
i think he was just a real interesting fella to have around
yeah jimmy
how much of that story is true
everything but the boring parts
a fair number ma
say your prayers
he is a good christian and he killed yankees jesus told me that made him an all right boy
somebody's in a vengeful smiting mood today
take care of each other boys you say your prayers
you were little jesse james when you left
but you got big
if there's anything we can do for you dr mimms we want to help
i have been on my back two weeks i am sick of it
you are sick of my company
no i mean of course not no
teasing you is completely unfair
what you do to me is unfair the teasing i mean
i should not tease a hero
so you are saying i should leave you alone and go spend time with jimmy younger
unfair you are completely unfair
i was thinking more along the lines of being a river pirate
a river pirate
arr hand over your jewels missy
thank god you grew out of that  you did grow out of that did not you
mostly it would be an all right life for a bachelor
you planning on being a bachelor your whole life jesse james
not if i find the right girl
and that is this right girl like
smart funny bossy always makes me think she is two steps ahead of me and big buck teeth
where will you find such a girl
honestly you would do if only you had the buck teeth
sparkling rocks
little ones
is this one of frank's shakespeare poems you are trying to quote
i have been planning on kissing you for a very long time
frank and me have to go away for a while
me neither
let the law 
laws do not touch men like thaddeus rains only justice does
whose justice yours or god's  when will you stop
when my name makes them cry in their sleep when i have brought them to ashes
i had to see you i am getting married
she is the most wonderful woman in the world cannot get her out of my mind
that is wonderful it is just i thought
she is beautiful smart and has the biggest buck teeth in all of missouri
that is why i picked it we can start a whole new life down here
are you going to be happy here mr james without all that excitement
blazing guns of the west true stories of jesse james only a dime in the hotel lobby
let me see that
stop it this is just sad
swimming swimming is good
yes ma'am
i cannot believe i had to blow up a train for you
you are a hell of a woman
do not swear
yes ma'am
but i like the presidential suite
that is the idea
not that day i am guilty of many things but that was mr thaddeus rains and parker that day
last february
i went myself to oversee the operation did not help much
no that one was close a couple fellas quit after that one
i figured
was it worth it
should have just killed thaddeus rains and been done with it
that is what i would have done
i am not hanged yet
you cocky little bastard
ahh you will miss me
no i will hang you  but i may miss you just a bit
he is too important james  they will set the army on you you and your wife
fair enough
you do not think god will mind do you
thank you
who needs to repair a leaky church roof
right here in church
i am the same age you were when you went off to war
and the same age web was no
yeah hey are you drinking whisky you are too young to be drinking whisky
not too young to shoot a man not to young to drink
i guess so
tonight why i am just getting ready to turn on the younger charm
you been with a girl ever
tell you something else  i cannot drink that good neither i am going to go outside and throw up
you do that
this time we will make an exception
jesse you explain to lyla my girl you know from that time
you are gonna tell her when you are resting up in bed with her jimmy
i hope you do not mind jesse james told me your name
oh you were talking to jesse
yes but just so i could find out who you were
not at all
i just though you were awful cute
thank you miss  
lyla devereux
gosh that is a pretty name buy you a drink
could we go upstairs and talk it is so loud down here
why do not we get a bottle of sherry to sip while we talk
that is so gentlemanly of you
i am doing you folks a favor 
they had to be dealt with
by burning down their homes
move you fools
and it is my pleasure to be here
yes sir
just perfect
i will teach these podunks what happens when they challenge the righteousness of progress
thirtyfive thousand sir coins and currency and the delay from the miles of destroyed track 
i will kill them for blowing up my railway
to be precise they did not blow up the tracks
then who did
we did
what is going on here man
we should go burn that school to the ground sir
i look forward to seeing it
what sir
i remember you
not such a menace now is he pinkerton
not to mention my men who lost their lives
oh no i would have done that but i would have made sure i killed them too
i want them arrested and hanged
would a jury around here convict their own i think not we are beginning an interesting game here mr rains
this is no game
i am afraid our adversaries do not agree
it is going to be a long winter
and there are some towns in missouri where james and his men can walk openly as heroes
i demand action
it is going to be a long spring
there are only four banks within that travel radius which they have not robbed
can you put men at all four
no need i have another tool at my disposal which will narrow it down to one bank
what is that
why their intense hatred of you of course

you will look like you consciously worked for the look
good point excuse me gentlemen
they still have to give 'em refreshments laced with mindaltering drugs
you are a fanatic
'gonna wait outside
make him
you know what i mean
you know what he is like he just wants to work on stuff that is cool
you do not wanna move do you
i can paint anywhere
if he is really a bully he will not cop to it anyway
bully are we talking about gary boyd or your dad
i forgot that is why you have to help me decide
no way you have this  destiny
c'mon i would not have a destiny without you my destiny would be dying at 20 from eating 
do not bring that up like a different girlfriend would would have let you die
you saved my life in alot of ways
prob'ly waiting by the phone for outpost to call we will leave it for him
we are not gonna let it
milo what about 
that is what i need to ask you  you know you cannot keep anything from me
i know i know
if you cannot deal with him on that basis you better get a new counselor
is not that  extreme
you are right it is  a working relationship do not know what i was expecting
what are you  what
it was a hate crime
i do not know what i am saying maybe  maybe they hired those guys
i cannot see outpost putting its reputation in the hands of people like that
go where you cannot get away from people like this
like this it is gary you are talking about
you think i do not know that
milo why would he 
you cannot just walk in either
whaddo i do
so you believe me
i remember
poor baby you know that is not true
he has thousands of employees milo 
it is for the museum he knows you are a painter if anybody should be invited 
i went to see the skywire model in gary's office you know just to hold it again
yeah give me a goodbye kiss
oh right hold on
it is gonna get cold
right wait a toast
you are just afraid to eat it
that will be a test will not it
instead of busting my chops you should do something about that girl fire her or something
i do not think he knows how
right that is that mean again
like i said shot in the dark
it is  milo is not it
yes sir i need to talk to you
give me two seconds with lacy here  go on in i will not be a moment
have a seat
i am i am sir
my goodness
i  just wanna help bring these guys to justice they are neonazis
let me look into it see that is being done frankly it is not my area
'just did not know who else to talk to
and outpost you are happy there
yes sir
'forgot to introduce you  i have a girlfriend
you cannot preempt yoga that is our biggest show
brian you wanna be a big deal do not you that is your dream in life
no but you can write your own ticket in the valley after this we are gonna bring down outpost
gimme the coordinates
is it your dish
you should have called a few times to bug me about your job prospects
outpost was his baby sure on the other hand we just learned gary boyd owns the skywire satellites personally
outpost does not own em
there's no hard evidence he knew about this anybody who could implicate him seems to have vanished
is not there a stigma bankrolling this guy
stigma larry 60 billion buys you some slack in this world
and the kid who wrote skywire  then gave it away they are calling him the digital robin hood
milo surprised he is not your guest
we tried
you better believe everybody's trying to sign him up
oh hi
he is pretty tight with his family
we could move 'em up here
he just likes to write code he is bummed there's so much secrecy and competition everybody trying to own everything
i think they call him the houseman 'cause guard sounds too weird
oh no thanks
there's a rumor going around maybe you have heard it
i do
okay i am gary
do i
somebody said i am just another philistine with reproductions
that is insane you are ahead of your time
that is what i told her my wife
maybe i am going too fast
too fast at least four companies are on the verge of workable convergence systems milo they 
take a look at this slightly different approach
you are making me young again
well  you sent for me
right right
what are you implying
were the flags for teddy
just once 'guess i was worried we did not have anything to talk about since work was offlimits non disclosure
did you
talk about work never
i meant did you find other stuff to 
oh yeah
you have been coming in early
it helps alice said it would help to focus on something   wouldo not know what i would do without her
34000 but they are real short lines 'just came out that way
the wrong place
the answer's not in the box it is in the band
you look a little tired
i am okay it is going well
'have a look
'sorry about the late notice
i am not much good at handwriting or parties
oh that is right you are clueless
you see that is hanging on the wall
'startup not 50 miles from here kid's on prozac
maybe we should all get on it
there may be a little less trust after your outburst
nothing does still i want him to like me
gary do not worry we 
just do what i am asking
longitude 48 degrees 06 minutes 
let's go
longitude 109 
wait he knows
in exchange for endowments they should just drop the pretense and name the schools after 'em
you do
i mean it is your life
man could he write code totally elegant he had his own style
those really weird short lines
we will come up with the next big thing
you wanna work  here
got out of my other commitment
unlikely all 14 cameras are frozen do we call randy and phil tell 'em there may have been a breakin
keep looking
what are we looking for
any irregularity in the pattern
let's get him in here
they know 'just they do not trust me with it so we will get the evidence first ask questions later
i am calling gary
where we going
i launched skywire just pray the last set of coordinates milo sent me connected us to gary's satellite
you know mine
you are famous around here
i am getting a teacher's pet rep
i would not worry about it you have gotta figure most people around here were their teachers' pets
were you
we moved around so much i barely knew my teachers
me too were you an army brat or something
something like that yeah
graphical interfaces for skywire i am s'posed to coordinate with you
show me
no please

maybe once i rewrote it anyway
you are compulsive
mmmmore like  i have a little trouble trusting people
why's that
long story not that interesting
then and now  but not right now
she saved my life
why would you do a thing like 
they would frame him
he is out of prison
no no never
they have got this guy in the doj maybe others we tell the wrong person it is over
who can we trust
there's always a logical answer  you just have to define the question
right but gary's tiedin to a lot of media conglomerates have to be careful who we pick
we could crossreference a data base on media ownership but not on our own computers not even at home
certainly not at my happy home
gary knows i am close on skywire we have to do this fast
before they kill somebody else too
oh man i would have to get into gary's house to get the satellite positions
you mean  break in
i do not know 
i thought the worst they would do is fire me who knew they took termination so literally
oh  i liked you i was checking you out
'cause their apartments might be bugged
what would he say
a beautiful geek what are the chances
the dishes are juiced up too
thank god
milo shrot suspects somebody broke into 21 i was in his office when he was reviewing the card readouts
perfect  how am i gonna get away from the party long enough to 
you could always say you have to go the bathroom
that is lame is not it
you will come up with something
at this point the worst thing i could do is anything out of the ordinary

bring it to the other location
but you said the other

hey we got seed money for the startup a millionfive
jesus teddy
what come on is it serious
i do not know
did you tell alice
what d'you mean
i dunno i guess larry's got me totally suspicious of that place
what does that mean
milo geeks do not have two girlfriends most do not have one
i did not plan this
oh we are not going to the campus
his snapples were in alphabetical order
well he micromanaged the company till it got too big  'guess he needs to micromanage something
she is a programmer
heavy graphical background doing designinterface for skywire apps  you will be working with her
i have got a girlfriend remember
right that is rare around here you know how nuns' remarried to jesus 'posties are married to outpost
can we buy into their ipo or is that a justice dept problem
speaking of which
yeah yeah
damn 'have to go back over there  be so much easier if we could walk in the front door
you do not look anything like a three yearold
unless it is a diversion milo's in my office he was tailgating so i 
i could get it out of him
you are not listening
where is he
we are too late take a look
wait a second i am the one who found out he was mucking around in here in the first place

i am on with a friend  look i would better go i love you
i love you vanessa
well it is kind of weird
we do not judge here
i do not wanna take over the family business
no he is really evil
ok scott no one really wants to kill anyone here they say it but they do not mean it
shame i was recommended by a friend
normally we would be eager to oblige 
you do not say how real does it feel
as real as you wish hot or cold humid or dry anything you like within reason
there are limits
three days
ah but you have not see the real me watch closely 
you mean you do not recall
promised who promised
there look
mr john steed please
i am afraid that is impossible
as you see
then you cannot come in
i have an appointment
no women not in boodles not since 1922
really  what happened in 1922
eh in here
we have met 
quite right but we still make the rules
rules are made to be broken
people too
then who wins
let me guess  'father'
something strange is happening and whoever knows about it does not want us to find out
directed by laser bounced by satellite quite possible
you need treatment mrs peel  you cannot resign
watch me
we want to help
to you  
a cover  for us  i am sorry
to find out who killed my husband
the doors and walls are monitored mrs peel this is a very secure establishment
so am i
next assignment
thank you steed
thanks valentine 
dr darling peter  all you 
an unholy trinity 
you killed my husband
for starters of course i had to kill the teddy bears as well 
too many cooks 
spoil the majority shareholders in wonderland weather i planned everything even the ministry recruiting you 
but i found you all the clues led me here 
of course i planned that too
but  why
you disappoint me emma  cannot you guess  for you it was all for you 
'our revels now are ended'
oh no emma they have only just begun 
i am already married 
valentine listen to me 
right bridesmaid now what have i left out oh yes i know the ring
you are mad
entirely on the other hand  mad people get things done let me show you 
destruction of their local weather systems i can zap a thousand chernobyls into the air
the result would be 
chaos transport paralysis crop failure  economic disaster frostbite or sunburn  on a massive scale you have seen a few samples
then that is stopping you
and you must be steed please do not get up
i had a spot of bother at the door
i should not wonder not a woman inside boodles since 
1922 why the kippers
red herring would have been too obvious do not you think
so what was all this  some sort of test
congratulations you have penetrated a bastion of male privilege i guessed you were not a stickler for tradition doctor
whereas you are
dyed in the wool but i can admire someone who does not play by the rules
rules are made to be broken
not by me play by the rules doctor or the game is nothing
and just what is the game
i say this is all terribly formal must i go an calling you dr peel
under the circumstances you may call me mrs peel
much better
we are not here to talk about the weather surely
a kipper or a red herring what were they investigating
really  i fail to see the connection
i had a feeling you would touche
yes indeed i need protection
oh absolutely but trubshaw's a man worth meeting no point setting out half shod
or half cocked
thank you trubshaw 
do you really think so
not all tradition is bad mrs peel no thank you
the most unpredictable piece on the board and always ready to protect his queen
that is predictable when i find a queen in need of protection i will let you know
as per mother's instructions
do we always follow mother's instructions
for a man in my position 
i have no choice why should you risk your life
after our fencing match i was rather hoping you would do the risking more tea
no thanks
i meant me
june july  august
the family does seem to be somewhat meteorologically inclined
any other vices
small talk  try the weather
you should be dead  how do you feel
i mean your man trubshaw  your bulletproof waistcoat  i thought you were just overdressed
i might say the same
why should they think that
you told them you said i arrived on a camel shot you four times left you for dead
frankly that is how i remember it
but that is absurd i may not be overfond of you steed but it is not my style
perhaps your memory plays tricks mrs peel
no but he must know incidentally my double left you with this
did you say formal i must dress
you mean my other self 
either way  may i ask why you dress in that fashion
i should have thought that was obvious   i am in mourning
how on earth can you tell
very good steed 
any ideas
well he was a fellow of the royal zoological society 
is that written in his shoe
common knowledge mrs peel 
she had this in her mouth there there
thanks   i see what you mean about letting me do the risking  hello
is there anything that is not
that is what we were working on
sounds as if someone's hijacked your research
 and by you mrs peel 
then a mad millionaire head of a secret defense establishment a group of eccentrics obsessed by weather 
 and by you mrs peel everything points to you  no sisters  no undiscovered twin
not that i know of  explanation
oh well   just my type mrs peel
have i trespassed on a male prerogative  we are being followed i saw him at trubshaw's 
here's the one that broke the camel's back
someone did not want us to get to the party
i expect we will have to gatecrash
i expect that is for you to know and me to find out 
it was peter  i saw him 
nothing personal
no trouble
because you always obey orders 
always  except 
i could be convinced if  i knew who poisoned me in the maze that kiss 
it was not me you have my word
keeping a stiff upper lip
is that all
not for a moment
you are playing games
are not we all mrs peel
i thought you played by the rules
i thought you did not
i am playing to win
winning is not everything
please do not tell me it is how you play the game
after you  mrs peel 
you do not trust me
as far as you trust me
you lied
i equivocated but you are not their big worry at present it is dr darling  he is disappeared 
no idea who no idea why 
teddy bears cuckoo clocks toys all childrengs things 
 or grownups who still like to be children
quite any childhood friends enemies
not to speak of peter and i were both loners there was nobody
why's he called 'invisible'
you will find out
i will catch you up do not worry he is expecting you
hurry  what for  i am just now 
you did not tell her
have we been invited
it is called black leather
intoxicating here have one of these
limpet bomb small very compact from trubshaw's
when all this is over we simply must get you out of that suit
you first
shall we
snuff  i must insist you try some
'the merry widow' i might have known where is the reception
have a look at this
where are you going
laying in supplies mrs peel weather may get very nasty and i have no umbrella 
you need not bother i cannot drag you further into this after all i am still the chief suspect
no bother mother and father think i have joined you i might as well
if you would been through what i have you would not 
what kept you
the plot  hello we must be going 
' in a beautiful pea green boat'
a fine night mrs peel 
still a bit chilly 
english weather you know after all we have been through i should say we deserve a long holiday 
have you any place in mind
as a matter of fact i have 
it is the latest thing mrs peel
our little paradise  just made for two
not quite
pity your mother came too 
must be trubshaw's busy i will send mother 
i am no spy  where do i fit in
you are saying i have no choice
mobile hq in a blue funk  cannot take chances i am looking after things while he is hiding out 
it is mother you have to convince he is very agitated  wait here
peter's brother  but 
halfbrother to be precise
i know all this
do you also know that during your final experiment your halfbrother inlaw was under surveillance
surveillance by whom
father she gave him an 'all clear' after a security test by dr darling
who's now vanished
makes two of us
are you suggesting that dr darling and valentine were somehow in this together but that is absurd
getting to what
the world council of ministers meets tomorrow to convene the new global defense initiative 
i fail to see 
well i cannot possibly go like this
let me guess  wonderland weather
very good mrs peel 
i shall need a small plane
you are not venturing alone surely
i am going to find out who killed my husband will you take these documents to steed
global warming
jungle plants in the arctic a lush english village transformed overnight into african scrubland blizzards in summer
so you say 
we want mrs peel
dead i am afraid
you reek of mrs peel's black leather 
it was you who gave valentine peel his security clearance  you are the mole who betrayed the ministry
brenda and i thought we would drop in
you did not come to talk about the weather surely
oh yes i did i want you to meet somebody  i expect you will like her
she may not know theory goes she may be very ill
how come you took so much interest in her dr darling
no her husband she says alice tried to warn us a trap tell mother beware tell father that is all
guilty until proven innocent
mother and father know best
you are getting yourself into terrible trouble my son weather's turning very nasty  and so am i
i think so thank you so much 
i feel sure of it
i am alice mother said you would be on your way mrs peel with you
she was 
both actually
this way

stay by the window by the window
valentine peel i see you have gone back to using your original face
the last one you will ever see
perish the thought

no costume  no blackface
i am sorry i am late
do you know how much information can be dispensed in one minute alone
i did not find out about this very important staff meeting until
so are you telling me everyone knew about this gettogether except you
i was not told about this until marie informed me as soon as i got off the elevator
i understand  but again in all honesty i was not informed
nigger  nigger  nigger  nigger
it is right and tight  good morning let me introduce you to everybody you know my assistant sloan
i am wid it
the name of the show
it is called mantan  the new millennium minstrel show
are these our two stars sitting here in front of my nose  which one is mantan again
mantan and sleep 'n eat  two real coons  i know we are way out there but it is satire
i want you take it there  all the way to the edge and back
what are there character traits
ignorant dullwitted lazy and unlucky
and sleep 'n eat is his comical sidekick
yep you guessed it
this could be bigger than amos and andy
let'em try  i will kill to make this happen
who are the other characters
in the projects  like eddie murphy's the pj's
we think so
sleep 'n eat what do you do
i just want you to meet him  keep an open mind
besides what does he know about negroes
if spielburg can direct the color purple and amistad our whiz kid can direct the mantan pilot
that is exactly my point  has he even directed actors before in anything
dunwitty do not leave
we just punched it up a bit  made it funnier
this has to be a big mistake
the big mistake was my not believing in your genius earlier  from the gitgo from jump street
hold on a sec i got a call
hello mommy let me get rid of this other call
i gots to go it is my moms
i want to meet her one day please tell her the great news  i am out like vanilla ice
i want to speak with you
go away unless you got my money
it is me peerless
it is been a long time
pull up a chair  oh excuse me this is my lady dot
pleased to meet you
daddy she is younger than me
my game is still strong  no viagra for me do not need no chemicals just my tonic
i thought you had promised mommy you stopped
how did you end up here
another one of your conspiracies to hold ya career back
the same old same old  trying to get my stuff through
nuthing i cannot handle
the truth is never let them seeya sweat  you do that that is half the battle
where do you go from here
three nights charleston south carolina
i did not mean that in life
always keep 'em laughing
is that so
not that often  he was excited to see you
so he drank himself into a stuper
the drinking is for the pain  it does not kill it just dulls it
so that is up with you
your father is proud of you
he did the best way he knew how junebug is stubborn just like you
why did not you tell me about this staff meeting
nobody told me anything
what good are you if you do not tell me stuff like this
it was not my fault  if i would have known i would have known
it hit me like a ton of bricks
how can this be  you and me at the same time the exact same thought it is scary
the idea was out there in the universe  now what
do you know how you will use him
not yet but this thing will never get made
the point being that him the networks do not want black people on television unless they are buffoons
sounds risky to me
you getting cold feet
i am in till the end
good  i am going to need your support
cannot you just quit  walk away
i feel like somebody hit me upside da head with a sledgehammer
my problem is mantan the new millenium minstrel show
why did you even come up with that shit if you did not want it made
that is the chances of mantan being picked up
i would not bet against it  my negroidal ass is stuck between the proverbial rock and a hard place
which one is your brother
the big one
i am gonna slit my wrists  cut my throat  for the love of joseph
break a leg
let's leave the man in peace so he can get ready
we both lied to him
what do you want me to say
just do not lie to me
the pleasure is mine
i am sorry i cannot help it  it is too funny
everybody shut up
a small victory is not that small when you have been use to losing
a gift
for what
no matter what you think you did come up with something unique open it
this is authentic not a repro circa turn of the century
is that good or bad
to me it shows part of our history in this country a time when we were considered inferior subhuman
i do not want to hear it
how long have you and hambone been hanging out
you are the one that put us together we are friends
that crazy brother of yours does not think so
he is just playing big brother
oh is he  you getting jiggy with mantan
please do not go there
dunwitty and i feel you have been getting too close to him getting his mind all messed up
i cannot lie to him  if he asks me something i tell him what i think
do you have to be so damn forthright
that is why it will be so much fun
the first and only time  a big mistake  i am gonna have to ask you not to see mantan anymore
work related or otherwise
dela kiss my big black ass
and that is how you got me in the first place
i did not think this was in your studies at nyu
give me the gun
he i am mona
hi mona

naw  i will take the zero
you feel good not nervous
i feel fine
not nervous  relaxed
sloan will you take your boss out of here so i can get ready
you sound like the media
this is nothing  it will blow over by tomorrow
same thing giuliani said
hope the same thing does not happen to me  that is some big shoes to fill
in time
yo dela they tried to lynch my black ass up in dat piece
what you did is dead wrong
oh is it  buddy boy in this business if people do not produce they get fired
sloan is the hardest working person i have ever met
do i have to spell it out for you in fact go ask sloan yourself
my name is manray goddamnit
it looks delicious
you hear me talking to you  the only time you come up here when something is wrong
c'mon mommy do not start with that i am an ungrateful son stuff
i said no such thing  all i said is that something must be wrong
if at first it is not what you want just work that much harder peerless
mommy please do not call me that
peerless i did not raise a buffoon we have enough of those on television already
please let me know when you hear from daddy get a number or something
i will be right over
he said that
yes he did
where is he
he is performing at some place outside of richmond virginia
i cannot go all the way down south
i do not even know why you are still concerned over him  daddy's not with you
regardless he still is your father
it is gonna be hard for me to get away with the show taking off
even more reason to see him  he will be overjoyed with your success
of course i am happy for you you have worked very hard for your success
yes i have very hard  has daddy called
you know how your daddy is
if and when he calls please do not forget to ask him if he is seen mantan

after my internship expired dela was impressed and offered me a position as his assistant
stop playing me sloan
just ask me what you want to know
oh you gonna make me say it
say what manray
did you ever sleep with dela
that is ancient history  that has nothing to do with you and i
do not try to change to the subject
why do not you answer
i know i will not be your puppet
you can go now
i wuz leaving anyway for good
good morning
where are you bound for
that is none of your business
is your mother not afraid on account of the highwayman to let one so young as you travel
i am not afraid of highwaymen  my man is armed and so am i
ten sir and make them short ones do you hear captain grogan
do not bully mr best  here are the pistols  god bless you my boy and when i count three fire
i never was more in earnest
the place seems more a farm than an innyard
the people are great farmers as well as innkeepers
i have acted as i think fit
sir i am a british officer
how do you do sir
not yet but i believe he intends to
the man that marries dorothy dugan must first kill me  do you mind that
faith i think you are a lad that is likely to keep your word
the meeting is arranged  captain best is waiting for you now
my mare is saddled and ready who's the captaings second
your cousins go out with him
i am harry james' son and will act as becomes my name and quality
oh it is with pistols we fight  you are no match for best with the sword
i will match any man with the sword
it must have been some other gate
is miss dugan well
there's only six miss dugans now poor dorothy
good heavens  whatever  has she died of grief
i have heard of them
sirrah  sirrah i am as good a gentleman as any in ireland
you are an impostor young man a schemer a deceiver
repeat the words again and i run you through the body
i deny your grace's accusations and beg you to say how you have been cheated
i do not know
your grace owes me seventy thousand frederics which i have honorably won
i will let down the steps for your honor
you are going to drive to the frontier
it is shameful  infamous  i insist upon being put down at the austrian ambassador's house
your honor must lower his voice
all europe shall hear of this
as you please
the gentleman has nothing contraband
yes sir  here is my letter
yes sir
you come highly recommended by herr seebach
herr seebach was a very kind employer
for whom else have you worked
no one sir  before that i served in the army but had to leave due to weakness of the loins
who else can give me information about you
only the agency of servants
have no fear  it will come out well for me
i believe they will deport you
i have faced that problem before
but if they send you away then what is to become of me
to risk one's life against such people is an imposition
i risk nothing for i am certain to kill him
certainly monseigneur does not your excellency consider her worthy of love
then you yield to me
on the instant  everyone must yield to such a nobleman as you
very well but a man who yields takes to his legs
that is a trifle strong
take to your legs low irish dog
not even that
how can i believe that there is not a man who has inspired desires in you
not one
have you not a man whom you value
that man has perhaps not yet been born
what  you have not met a man worthy of your attention
many worthy of attention but valuing is something more  i could value only someone whom i loved
then you have never loved  your heart is empty
but if when i love i am unhappy i will know that my empty heart was my good fortune
that is true but it seems to me impossible that you should be unhappy in love
a man may need to do that and find it amusing but a girl is bound by other laws
i believe you and i see i must hasten to leave for otherwise i shall become the unhappiest of men
how so
by loving you with no hope of possessing you
it is my only object
to make me wretched in two weeks
to love you until death  to subscribe to all your commands
the amusing thing is that you deceive me without knowing if it is true that you love me
deceiving someone without knowing it is something new for me  if i do not know it i am innocent
then i will respectfully take leave of her
poor man  and for that reason you want to begin where people end
i ask only a payment on account today  after that you will find me undemanding obedient and discreet
old fool
then you must get it

blackeyed sczortarska
dark valdez
do you expect me to believe that your lover brought you here tonight
yes  he brought me in his carriage and he will call for me at midnight
and he does not care about me
he is only curious to know who you are
if his love were like mine he would not permit you to come here
he loves me as i love you
will he wish to know the details of this night
you know that was like a quadruple negative
it is ten thirty in the morning
yeah if you have slept
you know the law  no liquor before noon could lose my license
do not you mean do not need no liquor license not taken away from me
i am  i am sorry
what do we do
whoever it is is not shooting at us
it was the grenade you fucking idiot look at him
maybe he will be there either way we have to go
maybe he is dead too maybe you killed them both mueller 
can anybody hear me
we found him like this 
we found him like this kendall was with me the whole  listen to me
before or after the explosion  mueller 
i do not know
shut up mueller
we do not know west is dead
what do you mean alone
we found him like this
shut up  west's dead
i asked for a policeman
you are under military arrest it is not gonna happen that is wrong with baseball
it is too slow
well it is a game of anticipation that is the beauty
i just do not like it
what do you like then
c'mon ray everyone hates the army during basic i will tell you straight i hated it here
you did basic here
they are dead are not they
i am not telling you what happened
okay but i would like to know about the other cadets what they were like  nice guys
yeah and that is all i am saying
that son of a bitch
that would be my reaction too 
he is lying
well why did not you say so we will just drop all your charges then 
i am serious 
yeah we know pike did
you saw west's body
of course 
they would have killed us both you want me to write a confession i will write a confession
you saved kendall's life 
but not pike's
you wanna bet
oh you do not what else do you have on me you have not found any bodies yet have you
we have found all of them
do what
hunting  we had to hunt him 
and the bodies
you will not find them will not find west either he is too good
washout rejects guys he said were dumbfucks too stupid to know they dead
he is telling the truth up to a point
tell us about the other guys the ones west weeded out
there were six of us
no did he tell you about it about the business childs ran
what business
pills shots you name it basic's a lot easier when you do not feel pain 
one went off yeah but it did not touch him  i thought you knew this 
mueller was alone in the cabin
would you have believed me
we can prove that you are not ray dunbar impersonating a fellow cadet is a courtmartial in and of itself 
how do you know that
sir dunbar sir
you know how to work a pistol dunbar
sir yes sir
the rest of you fallout for physicals
your weapons sergeant
oh bullshit he is a fucking convict you know how much he hated west 
west he is dead
so did we why did not you come
west's any kindling for afire
i mean i killed him  is not that what we all wanted
wandering through a hurricane trying to find this place it is getting bad out there   where is west
we just want to check your pack 
do i
you hated west more than any of us
maybe but that do not make me a killer 
you are the only one missing a grenade
which anyone coulda taken out of my gear on the chopper were you watching your pack on the ride in
who you gonna trust ray him or your friend
enough to go to prison childs' px scam mueller was in on it 
you are lying 
pull up my sleeve right arm
becoming a morphine addict during basic ai not exactly something you want to broadcast only mueller and childs know
you saw west right how was he killed
full clip to the body 
from up close or far away
his chest was hamburger 
what do not you know
this is a lot of information to be getting i have to think 
put it down
coast guard special detective detail we feel this incident may have put the beaches of florida at risk
but not the only victim right
what happened to degrees
i did not kill him 
then who did
no poetic justice though
right in front of us mueller went after him but we held him back
mr hardy
how many murders did you cover up one five maybe an even ten
can i go to jail for punching a guy who's been shot
my heart weeps
there's that word again  as i told you i was not in the room when everyone started shooting
i was just thinking of that is going to happen to your careers when my father gets through with you
i did not do anything 
because i was standing next to him
i did not 
but you cannot prove it you cannot prove anything until we find the bodies
i do not know 
where are they
maybe he
been better  i read about that is been happening with you i should have called 
what kind of trouble are you in
would i have called you if it was not if there was any other way 
tell me what i can do
and here you are going out of house how is that make you feel jules
cadet roberto r nunez killed right in front of me
the guy in interrogation said he would only talk to a cop
and i am the closest thing to it right
he can wait kendall's out of surgery
who killed pike
someone must have got a shot off he was not exactly a moving target
there was a hurricane bill the wind probably moved it
habeas corpus  you have to have a body to have a crime
okay then let's widen the search to include the endzone in giants stadium and the trunk of my car 
without the body we have no physical proof we need a confession
not for me
jag gets here in three hours try for the confession
home i am done
what about the confession
was dead right you think dunbar's on the level
maybe but it is my fault and i will carry it
the senator
do not be i am not cut out to deal with the west's of the world
you are a good soldier bill
i thought you said that was not a compliment
i am not going to cover for you bill not for this
or what you have gone round the bend 
west had a partner someone who knew how to get things done
get your hands away from the desk
fantastic you want to tell me that is going on
you knew sergeant west
he was our drill here mangs older than sand
sergeant west's served for twenty three years he is the public face of the modern army
and you notice i am not in the army anymore
you and the colonel go back
he got me through basic and a lot of other stuff i owe him
wording and your friendship with the colonel aside i am not comfortable having you involved in this
subtlety really is not one of you finer points is it osborne
levi who names their kid levi 
senator jonathan kendall of ohio
christ remind me to thank bill for mentioning that on the phone 
excuse me
is dunbar cute
that is the most unprofessional 
something like that
you made me look like an idiot 
you are right we should sit in silence
we are in the middle of a murder case 
best time for banal chitchat
you had a mobile of bayonets above your crib
something like that you
i lost a bet
the very same
you do understand that there's absolutely no way i could ever be attracted to you right
i plan to grow on you
you are off to a late start
so noted
imagine what it must have been like for them out there what do you think of dunbar
he is telling the truth up to a point
what point
being back here gives me the willies
not the happiest of memories
got it
have no fear osborne we have not yet begun to fight
i lied wait for it
i do not think that has anything to do with 
everyone's capable of murder osborne
i do not know
watch me
you said you owed styles and now you are gonna turn your back on him
phenomenal at taking bribes right
what happened next
and if they are asked that is what they will tell the world
buttfucks the cabin
little bit
let's go talk to bill
they got their stories straight
positive hardy they planned this
good idea
you could not have known 
yeah i could have should have
you wanted to get the truth
now i go home get drunk and try and forget this ever happened
think it will work
that is gonna stay my secret
right back where we started
is not this how your story goes
hardy for chrissakes 
where is west's body
no death certificates no crime
there are degrees of truth officer always degrees
you are a good man hardy
yeah i can wait till you are off the base and do it myself
leaving without saying goodbye what are you gonna do
go home get drunk and try and forget this ever happened
think it will work
in case you need me to testify about the shooting they will clear you
yeah but he was a lot of other things too thanks
what are you talking about
although that will not matter much when coupled with the murder charge 
the faggot speaks
you ever been in a hurricane mueller
you ever been in a hurricane mueller
poor fucker my ass
you better watch it faggot i am not sure you and childs did not do him 
yeah and he does not know when 
i remember now it was before the explosion 
oh you remember now 
i am about two seconds away from seeing if fairies really can fly 
so you took off your shirt
what the truth please there are degrees of truth officer always degrees things are not what they seem
he wanted more than that
you are gonna die tonight faggot clear as day
no one else heard it
he whispered it in my ear
because he would shot mueller
but you did not see it right
we have been making progress i see
fifty minutes
then he is mistaken you know i really do not think my father would approve of this line of questioning 
wrong answer 
we did get our stories straight but not because we killed anyone  it was because i threatened him
he came after us and i told dunbar he had to kill him
toughens us up pike you do not like it quit
blame the nigger then huh someone turns up dead you just look for the darkest face in the crowd 
what the fuck are you doing
shut the fuck up  he was gonna cut him loose
i used it to start the fire 
we are not going anywhere
the fuck are you talking about 
you are to be stripped of all weapons and placed under guard 
shut up
 failure to comply with this arrest is a court martialable offense in and of itself 
no no that was cadet dunbar 
you mean ray dunbar well that ai not right
he asked to see a policeman we are getting him a policeman
but this guy you called he is not even army 
then it is unofficial
it is too neat
he tried to burn dunbar to us you do not do that if you are not involved
i am giving you a chance to walk away
the army kicked you out for drugs
it was on that night karl met his destiny and i met mine almost
that is great
i just saw the woman i am going to marry i know it but then i lost her
tough break most men have to get married before they lose their wives
i am going to spend the rest of my life looking for her that or die alone
jesus kid  let me guess real pretty blonde hair blue hat
who is she where does she live
kid do not waste your time she is out of your league
a few rabbits but i think one of them was already dead
that would explain the indigestion
thank you
good luck kid
edward bloom

it truly is
i do not expect to
i will go in right now and get that eye
then do it
fine i will
fine you do it
fine i am doing it
i brought it
let's see it
i did not know she belonged to anybody
a pleasure
absolutely be good for you to talk to him
thirty years maybe more
how would you describe him
fiveeleven oneeighty regulated hypertension  how would his son describe him
a thousand times he caught an uncatchable fish
not that one the real story did he ever tell you that
what did she look like
well she uh
was she nekkid
and when i am 38 you will be 48 and that is not much difference at all
i suspect it will hurt a lot
i promise someday when i am really supposed to
how did you know
i am not convinced you should be happy
i am sorry have i offended you
i was 18 he was 28 turns out that was a big difference
i see i thank you for your time
i can get it i can just
please go just go
i will
and from the moment i saw her until the moment i die she is the only one
lucky girl
i am sorry jenny i am
i was dreaming
what were you dreaming about
no i understand
he was slipping her a little extra cream
can i take your picture
you do not need a picture just look up handsome in the dictionary

well we were all set to but there was a complication
truth is i have been thirsty my whole life never really known why
you were talking about your wedding
and i like you
i can
that is your name giant
beats me
just to be sure you can take my pack
friend of yours did you help him out of a bind
come on will everyone likes that story
your mom says i cannot tell you that one anymore you get nightmares
i am not scared

having a kid changes everything i mean there's the diapers and the burping and the midnight feedings
did you do any of that
you learned from the best
the old lady by the swamp
she was a witch
no she was old and probably senile maybe schizophrenic
i saw my death in that eye and this is not how it happens
so how does it happen
surprise ending would not want to ruin it for you
you owe me threefifty
there's a lot you do not know about me
you are right
you mean while i am here
i would just like to know the true versions of things events stories you
i will
you know where the chemicals are
i used to do it when you were gone remember i used to do it a lot
i said this is not how i go the last part is much more unusual trust me on that
it is rude to talk about religion you never know who you are going to offend
oh so you know
i think someone has not
i have no idea who you are because you have never told me a single fact
i have told you a thousand facts that is all i do will i tell stories
only on the surface but that is all i have ever seen

you need to go
probably tonight
you do not have to
i am going with you
did you
they met at auburn
what about the details how they fell in love the circus the war you never told me any of that
that is because most of it never happened
but it is romantic
mmm what i know better than to argue romance with a french woman
everyone loves my father he is a very likeable guy
do you love him
what is true i have never heard my father say a single true thing
i need you on my side
i am always on your side and i think you should talk to him
your father had a stroke he is upstairs with your mom and dr bennett
is he going to be okay
we swam the atlantic it is not that big really
ruth mchibbon offered to pick you up at the airport
we rented a car
you did not need to do that you just did not
he is up with your father
you do not talk about those things not yet
really that is wonderful
of course
what i mean is do you really know that is going on in his head
yes but that is a different
well clearly you do not but i am not the mystery you are trying to solve right now
no but it is weird she seemed to recognize me
do you know who that is
not everything your father says is a complete fabrication
he just fell asleep josephine's with him
i suppose your grandmother's house when she passed on but we sold that right away your cousin shirley bought it
so you never bought any land
heavens no we had a hard enough time keeping the mortgage on this place
that is okay
yes thank you
fifty thousand almost exactly
what for
you know what for
no i do not
i got you those trousers from paul smith
i have been buying you stuff all week i have been buying him stuff all week
such as
those are not presents that is normal friendship stuff
i paid for those guitar cases
yeah it was quite good actually some bits i really liked
the sets were good
there's over eighty thousand here
what do you mean
you know what i mean babe it is enough we can stop
do you want to stop
it is nothing i burnt myself
that is not a burn
it is i did it cooking
thank you
name it
what are you doing here
leave him
you have you have actually fallen for this prick
no i have not
uh yes
hang on hang on sorry but like who are you
you must find some glasses small for the toast and some plates
what are you doing here
i am asking what you are here for
he says he feels safe here
oh  we are russian
yes i know
toast first then we talk seriously i can see you are serious about us
of course not alexei he is is my problem
i asked her if you were happy to see us i find it hard to tell with you
yes it is okay thank you for the food
plans are for the architects politicians and so forth
you must have a visa or something
you are asking for my documents
no no
uh do you like england
classic  thank god she says 'yes'
oh nothing
tell me
no it is too judgmental
tell me what he said
he says why did you send to russia for a wife
no it is not that
do you believe in love
i suppose it is i mean define your terms
fine i thought you were leaving today
to be indoors on such a day it is crime
you can stay tonight
i have brought you trouble maybe i should have come alone
good night
he wants money
tell him to put the kettle down and i will give him money
i will give him money tell him to put the
he wants the money from your bank
i will fucking give it to him we will go down there
you do not understand he wants all the money that is in your bank
i have got eight hundred pounds oh jesus
he is sure you can do this of course you can not
oh jesus of course i cannot
i am so sorry
leave her alone
happy bath day
that is wrong
they go
of course they go yes yes
they go
i do not want to know
it makes it faster if i do not speak to the men they fall faster it is pretty obvious why
that is a relief it is nice to know i am a regular guy
why else would you send off for me if you just wanted sex just go to a prostitute
well as it turns out i did
no i do not
in the world
i know you just want to punish me 
i do i want to very badly
so you are just going to be vindictive
in every sense if at all possible
you cannot hurt me more than i am hurt already
well nadia it it is all the same to you i would like to give it a bash
what no you are not
i am going i am i am going to be sick
no you are not how nice one how dumb do you think i am 
have you got your passport
i do not have any money
i do not want to talk about him
fine absolutely must be disappointing though must come as a hell of a shock
look if you want to know is he better in bed than you then yes he is
oh jesus
if what you want to know is does he have a bigger cock than you then yes he does
of course of course of course he does of course thank you thanks
but you know so what
he will come back
excuse me
he left me my passport and ticket it is pretty clear he wants to see me again
yeah i tend to tie up and abandon women i really want to see again too
no but you tend to tie them up
why not
shut up i am not listening
you do not want to talk about it
so that is it like having to fuck men you hate
i do not hate you
and it is wrong
and who says what is wrong
and that would be morals that would be one's own moral sense of decency
that is a moral orgasm john tell me how it feels exactly
so what then you just detach sex from everything
whereas wet 'ng wild is an emotional journey tied and tethered it is pretty moving huh like anna karenina
listen i did not go rooting around in your private stuff
sometimes neither
some what does that mean
there's nothing wrong in liking sex john
i do not like sex i do not think i will be having sex ever again
i think it is my safest bet do not you
oh i think you will recover okay i think you got what you paid for
you did not mind too much
so what did you want i think we understand each other no
you do not understand me
you do not understand you either
get out
you are throwing me out
get out
you do not have to say anything
what i i was not saying
please there's no oh
i was not saying anything
then okay  so how old were you when you met him
yeah he is a smashing bloke
the rest of the world john it is not all like st albans

it is alright
no i think i better just go
okay thank you

he gets as much as he wants
there was a change in plans
i could use some help  show me around  i will pay you for your time

maybe  if i come visit we can find out
i would like that
i am taking you back
guess i am on a roll
she is such a long way home for you
time i have got plenty of
i am amused

why me
they said send a detective if i could spare one  i can always spare you
he was my partner
they are blaming it on you  christ conklin you did not even tell me you lost the prisoner
i planned on catching him captain
how  you do not know the place  you do not know the language  get on the plane
he killed a police officer
your plane's at nine am  be on it that is orders  period
incompetent is letting people waltz through a secure area wearing your uniforms carrying official documents
it is not allowed
we are police officers
you are foreigners
work with me  i want your best detective
do you know what this is
why do not you ask your chief detective
the young are eating the old something that usually does not happen here
can we skip the poetry inspector
your visa has expired  be on a plane in twentyfour hours or you will be deported
while you were hanging out at the visa office we found the sonofa bitch
twentyfour hours detective
for god's sake ohashi i need your help  let me out of here
you had my help detective
if anything happens to her while i am here 
goodbye officer
i am impressed  but let's use the short form  i am looking for 
 kobo i know  he killed two of my partners  one in new york one at the printing plant
he will be dealt with
the families who control the casinos
the feds would be onto you in a month
the other plate is currently in new york in the hands of kobo's man find it for me
you trust me
i will pay you
swiss bank deposit  gold bullion whatever you want  you know the city and the police
if i say no
you are smarter than kobo  you know the price of deceit  think about it
i do not have to
you want him dead too
after a court convicts him  he belongs to me
we were worried to death  it is awfully kind of you
you certainly have a nice place here
well stocked
if he will not cooperate
mr sebastian is a host who wants to be appreciated  we will appreciate him and he will cooperate
i do not think there is another human being in this whole world who would have helped us
not to be trapped
you underestimate the trap mary
then go get him
that would not be very sporting
here's your check my boy  thank you
it is not an easy thing to meet your maker
and what can he do for you
can the maker repair what he makes
would you like to be modified
had in mind something a little more radical
that is the problem

dr tyrell
tyrell could help us sebastian

considering the nature of your work that could be unhealthy
they will change the limit before i change my mind

too old
but if you could
me too
of course
nothing  she wanted to know about suck night
what night
lots of places  the tours the clubs the silicone shows private parties
what shows
i do not know nothing about it
you have not felt yourself to be exploited by the management in any way
for holes
of course he is not real  you think i would be working here if i could afford a real snake
it is a good job
you mean the snake
does it eat
come on
i bet i would
little dirty holes the bastards drill in the wall so they can watch a lady undress
of course not
why should i be
for the responsibility of your power  being a police bureaucrat you have got more than your share
you have a little boy  he shows you his butterfly collection plus the killing jar
you are watching tv and suddenly you notice a wasp crawling on your wrist
i would kill it
is this testing whether i am an android or a lesbian
i would never get an abortion
why not
that would be murder mr deckard
in your opinion
it would be my child
sounds like you speaks from experience
i know you think it complicates your work but i am here to help
i have already got more help than i need
i think you need more help than you have got
two of us might be more effective than one
i work alone

what do you want me to do
there's a lot i have not done with a man before
you did

i do not like the noise  just practice  practice makes perfect
good for a smart girl to feel stupid  part of your education
i never felt better
you mean a woman
ten years
nope  nobody could stand me that long
because it is not
do not you think anything that can suffer deserves to be considered
andies only simulate suffering  if they are programmed for it

have you ever retired a human by mistake
nothing is infallible but so far the voightkampff scale bas been foolproof
like you said mr deckard a machine can be a hazard  the voightkampff scale is a machine is not it
one that relies on human interpretation  where is the subject
sitting next to you
the machine works  she is
memory implant  she was programmed but i think she has transcended her conditioning  i think she was beginning to suspect

i think you might of dreamed this one anthony
no it is a real episode the killer is leading him across the city by calling different pay phones
see that is what i am saying it has the logic of a dream
the point is the killer always goes may i speak to starsky he says his name
what does starsky say
he says this is he
this is he
no this is he
kind of except we have already got the keys
that is true but what if they change the locks
would they do that
who knows that is why i filed it down
see your mind is very good with the more mechanical details whereas my strength would be 
she is an attractive older woman
what do you think the cops have
but dignan do you really know that much about rare coins
i know about money anthony i know the value of money plus the earrings are worth three times that
every valuable item in the house was on that list
i do not appreciate you ridiculing me
how was i ridiculing you
yeah i saw it
i am lookout
dignan it is got an alarm
i do not think so just reach on in
that sets it off
no just do it real quick  i will meet you down there

eight dollars
that is not bad
hang on a second
just turn right here
that is a good question no i do not i am just being hypocritical here however i will say 
nothing go ahead

dignan stop
you are right you are right
where is the other stocker
there's another stocker right

like he meant it
like i am going to hunt you down and kill you
what do you think
anthony he sat in the car and watched a 411 in progress he got what he deserved
he was the driver dignan he did what he is supposed to do
i do not like to use that credit card dignan
why not
because my mom gets the bill
she is not going to notice anthony
i do not want to use it
well then cut it in half
i keep it for emergencies
anthony we are on the run this is an emergency it is only fair that
dignan those are not running shoes

well those treads stink you would blow a knee out racing on those
you were spoiled rotten
i will say it

no i am not saying her i am just saying i do not know
it is a great shirt do not worry about it
i know but once you get inside you are home free
right get back to me on that one once your plan is worth a shit

he looked too shakenup
i do not know i do not know anything except phil says they got him and he is in jail
and if future man does not get let out of jail in 48 hours then we go back all right
i am not playing any more golf

cause i am not getting any better it is a waste of time
you have only been playing for two weeks bob it takes a long time to learn this game
you think i am improving
yes you just got to stick with it
no i do not mind
i know it must of been a bad experience but it does not sound like it was your fault
well i did not mean to electrocute him but the whole operation was my idea
i do not like that word prank bob i was trying to do something more than a prank
prison tatoos i got to be pretty good it is not like drawing on paper
yeah but he still has the aggravation three days sitting in a cell
were you adopted bob
why do you say that
well because you guys do not look alike
no i was not adopted
jesus christ no
it was stupid
cause you would of let my brother rot in jail
hopscotch the code name is hopscotch
no i am having a heart attack of course i am ok that is that supposed to mean
nothing i was just asking
my walkie talkie's busted i cannot tell that is going on

god that does sound corny oh your skin feels so soft and silky but it really kind of does
you are anthony
what do you mean
feel this
the front stairs
where were you
just settling an old score you might say revenge
that sounds like a lot of bullshit that will land us in jail
we might have to take that chance cause i feel pretty strongly about this
is that buckethead
wait a second
that is your friend anthony
we are going too slow it looks like we are following him
well this is not really a party per se
you do not celebrate til it is over
you are the faggot
i do not know about that
the one and only little richard
i do not know bob what about one of those
not even for emergencies
they are
so who's going to know
my brother
that never would of 
let's cut the bullshit
what are you talking about bob
can you use a coaster
yes i did
ok bob
it is true dignan
well what do you want to do you want to steal one or just drive your car
i will just drive my car
as much as i want when these plants bud i will probably have about six thousand dollars worth of weed
six thousand dollars come on bob
you should take a look i have an entire crop in my backyard
good question
you are paranoid bob
yeah but do not tell anybody
i cannot believe you said that
what did i say
i told you he is crazy
i warned you dignan
you said it like it was a big joke bob like he is wild
no i was saying crazy like a lunatic
i know that now he is a fucking psycho
well do not blame me i told you
i do blame you bob and woah look at her
maybe she turned
let's just go
that is your domain
that is your fucking problem you are a shithead
i just want to see how much bullets it takes
god dammit
he electrocuted someone
yeah one of the nicest old guys you would ever know
that is too bad
you know when somebody gets electrocuted their skin starts smoking at least swifty's did
i am putting a piece of tape on my nose
shhh slow down bob drive natural
this is natural
that is good keep it at forty
did we get it
be cool bob be cool  make that light
do not count it
no i was calm
no all he will remember is a guy with a piece of tape on his nose
i do not want to talk about it
that is true that would give me nightmares
bob i have got nightmares
i told you they were there
so it is my fault
he would not move
i do not know
it is registered in my mother's name
what the fuck possessed you
you are the one who kept saying ram him
see you in a little while
my brother's in jail
what are you talking about
but it is not his how can they arrest future man
they said he is a drug dealer
well the marijuana crop is a good start
that could be anybody's
they also found my two beam scale in the garage
since when is it a crime to have a scale in your house everybody has a scale
the cops say it is a special kind of scale drug dealers use in selling marijuana
so tell them the truth what do you use it for
i was just going to use it to see how much i had
i do not know
then how come they have not set the bail yet that is unconstitutional
we will have to see when we get back
well obviously we got to go back
bob that makes no sense
dignan he is my brother i cannot just leave him there
this could be a trap
come on dignan
do not come on dignan me
i am going back
not in that car you are not
watch me
good luck since i got the keys
i cannot do that bob
dignan you are going to give me those keys or you are going to get hurt
do not threaten me bob

and the landy woman
one last push one
what do you mean
go to the airport get a plane i will have a brass band waiting for you
save it for bourne
bourne comes here why
that is not gonna fly
with all due respect pam i think you might have wandered a little past your paygrade
i want to know about treadstone
what are you after pam you want to fry me you want my desk is that it
i want to know what happened
dead in a ditch drunk in a bar in mogadishu who knows
excuse me
we were throwing money at him throwing it at him and asking him to keep it dark
may i finish
so that is your theory  conklings reaching out from the grave to protect his good name  the man is dead
you do not know what you are getting into here
hold on  he said he wants to come in
i was not sleeping  you ok
oh god it must have been bourne
did he say anything to you
no it must have been bourne
do not know
jesus i zorn i have to call his family tell them
i am sorry ward
i would rather stand if it is all the same to you
i do not exactly know what to say  i am sorry
'why' would be enough for me
i am not a traitor i have served my ountry
and pocketed a fair amount of change while doing it
why not it was just money
and danny zorn what was that
had to be done
no good options left
well you are probably right i guess that is all that hubris is
the sooner the better
is it a slam dunk no but
something's been going on here in europe and it is still going on post conklin who's been in berlin
lots of people
including landy  she had access to the archives
nobody you  i had to tell you right
show me again
i speak english
it is nothing it is just a picture
no it is because you do not know how they died
no i do
then what
i killed them
how how can how can you be here and say this
i do not want you to forgive me
you are a liar
you know i am not
you are a liar
look at me
i cannot let you do that either
because you are afraid
no  because you do not want to know how it feels
is this really happening
i am sorry
felt a little light
drop it
sorry old habits
i like it here  last time i saw you was greece you had a good spot
she would not let me  she is the only reason you are alive
shot dead in paris dead the night you walked out
i do not know
who sent you to greece
a voice a voice from the states someone new
pamela landy
i do not know who that is
that is going on in berlin
i do not know why would i lie
i am sorry
how long how long do i have  
 my coat  but we should 
conklin up front
i will get the book
no there's nothing new
you are sure  we should still  we should write it down
two years we are scribbling in a notebook 
 it has not been two years 
i do remember something good all the time i remember you
i worry when you get like this
it is just a nightmare
i do not mean that i worry when you try to ignore it
i should be better by now
one day it will be different it just takes time  we will make new memories you and me
the telegraph office
but we were so careful
we pushed it we got lazy
he was at the campground yesterday
no not this this is real  and he is right there 
we cannot wait to be sure
i do not want to move again i like it here
 there's places  we cannot afford to be wrong
 not yet 
 it is just him 
 yeah  one guy  i do not think he was ready 
 hang on 
where are you going
i am going to bail on the other side and wait this bridge is the only way he can follow
what if it is not who you think it is
if he crosses the bridge it is
there must be another way
i warned them marie i told them to leave us alone
jason please do not do thisit will not ever be over like this
there's no choice
tell me later
but you found another choice
i did
it would not have changed the way you feel
it might have
you do
i only dream about people who are dead
jason you know exactly what to do that is your mission now
who is pamela landy
you hear me i believed you
is she running treadstone
what is this a game
i want to hear it from you
last week an agency field officer went to make a buy from a russian national
a russian
i killed him
conklin stuff on conklin 
so when was i here
what do you mean
for treadstone in berlin you know my file i did a job here when
no you never worked berlin
my first job
your first assignment was geneva
that is a lie
you never worked berlin
i was here
i want to come in
i want someone i know to take me in
alexanderplatz 30 minutes under the world clock alone give her your phone
ramstein air base germany  before the wall fell you would have woken up in a russian prison hospital
are you disappointed
that is that
do you think you can read are you well enough
sounds like a threat
you did not answer my question
i am working on it
who's going us
there's only a consulate they sent a field officer out half an hour ago 
then get a number they need to know who they are dealing with
 uplink all relevant files to kim    and i want them to contact anyone who had anything to do with treadstone 
 the hotel  how far 
i want to look at the room  check it out
but we can relax we tracked him he is on a train to moscow
what the tapes
hold on  yep and abbott just direct dialed moscow from his room
is there is all there
 no  not me  no other people 
 shut up  just shut the 
that is where we came out
it is a lot of money pam
we are talking raw unprocessed kgb files it is not something we can go out and comparison shop
who's this
pamela landy again where do we stand
me four years
yes sir  ma'am
depression anger compulsive behaviors they had physical symptoms  headaches  sensitivity to light 
you were his local contact you were with him the night conklin died you are coming with us
are you an expert in amnesia
look what do you want me to say i was there i believed him
believed what
i believed jason bourne had suffered a severe traumatic breakdown
so he fooled you
if you say so
you felt nothing no spark two young people in paris dangerous missions life and death
you mean did i want a date
did you
these were killers conklin had them all jacked up they were dobermans
some women like dobermans 
what do you want from me i was reassigned i am out
and why is that
because he is doing just what he said he would do he is coming for us
it is got caffeine in it that is all i know
i do not know he was sick he wanted out i believed him
yup  the main word there the file heading translates as treadstone
what the hell is a treadstone
are we locked up
his wife in room 645 then she shot herself 
alright i want you kurt and kim to stay on bourne track everything that is out there
yes in that order
and what about you anything
we just had a funeral is not that what it means in england as well
then we will just have a peek at the wounds  dig 'em up
did not want your father to die either did ya but it happened
it was in latin sir
saying goodbye in their own way  in outlawed tartans with outlawed pipes playing outlawed tunes
i will invade england and defeat the english on their own ground
invade that is impossible it 
we must sue for peace
with cavalry  not heavy like the english but light fast horsemen like you nobles employ  we could outmaneuver their bowmen
it is suicide
you have all sworn to longshanks
my father hears that longshanks has granted prima noctes
clearly meant to draw more of his supporters here
no but his weight with the commoners could unbalance everything the balliols will kiss his ass so we must
he was a modest man
it will not be long before longshanks too is encased in stone and his crowns divided for others to wear
homage is nothing it is the crown that matters
the crown is that of scotland and scotland is william wallace
he will i know he will
i hear this wallace is a bandit nothing more
nothing new majesty we have sent riders to speed any word
impossible  how dare you bring a panicky lie
so the scots will have none of them will they my armorers have already made a thousand
the scots will fight for us
what choice do they have now they must serve us or starve
but if we have not caught wallace 
you let wallace escape your whole army you cannot blame me for this
you directed me to report to you the moment the king's conference was ended
so i did and what was so important about it
scotland he intends 
his majesty was quite keen that you should understand 
all so very boring he wants me to learn to fight too so let me do it
look at me i said look at me
yes i had thought that i was loathsome to you perhaps i am if i may be excused m'lord
you may
you mock us with a smile
i am cheerful with a plan to soothe your miseries all of england shudders with the news of renewed rebellion
wallace's followers
wallace's for treason there is no trial tomorrow he will be charged then executed
you fancy him
hamish i thank
mornay has come so will the bruce
we are here to stay we do not care to live if we cannot fight beside ya
i rest
your rest is making me exhausted
probably but we cannot win alone we know that this is the only way
i do not want to be a martyr
we have lived a dream together a dream of freedom
no one of us is enough
how many
three maybe more
with your father and brother gone they will kill us and burn the farm
it is up to us hamish
i wanna have supper waiting
we will get those english pigs tomorrow
aye we will get 'em
you win
that depends on the man
i could crush you like a roach
i will not
i should'a remembered the eggs
a patriot
we do not split up
they used hounds on us in ireland it is the only way
he was so brave with courage alone he nearly won
so more men were slaughtered uselessly
he broke because of me i saw it he lost all will to fight
all men lose heart all betray it is exactly why we must make the choices we make
your pardon m'lord he asked me to come in his stead
shall i leave m'lord
if he wants his queen to rule then you stay and learn how i will deal with him
no he did not
then why does he stay my scouts say he has not advanced
a mindless barbarian not a king like you m'lord
this is what happens when you must send a woman and a fool
forgive me sire i thought that generosity might demonstrate your greatness to those you mean to rule
my greatness is better demonstrated with this
let her speak
he will fight you forever but what does he fight for freedom first and peace so grant them
against thy king thou vile fool hast thou anything to say
never in my whole life did i swear allegiance to your king 
it matters not he is thy king
thank you for inviting
i will invite you again but your mother thinks i am crazy
you are and i will come again
no you do not choose your dreams your dreams choose you
i accept your proposal
i am not just saying it
nor i
but i will not give you up to any nobleman
you scare me
i do not want to scare you i want to be yours and you mine every night like this one
this night is too beautiful to have again
i will be with you like this forever
shush it is only been a day  and it is seemed like forever
tonight then
my parents are growing suspicious i cannot keep meeting you every night
yes you are and you must wake
i do not want to wake i want to stay with you
and i with you but you must wake
i need you so much i love you
wake up william wake up
last night i slept with a member of the war council
he should not be telling secrets in bed
ah oui englishmen do not know what a tongue is for
wife of edward the king's son
it is battle i want not talk
but now that i am here will you speak with a woman
i have been given nothing god makes men what they are
did god make you the sacker of peaceful cities the executioner of the king's nephew my husband's own cousin
peace is made is such ways
slaves are made in such ways
because of the way you are looking at me now the same way as when we met
every man dies not every man really lives
and the common man who bleeds on the battlefield does he risk less
and i will consult with mine
they have tricked us
that is the crazy man saying lord
the dogs have a scent my scent someone must have given it to them
who would do such a thing
no english lord would trust an irishman
bring out our spearmen and set them in the field
aye but it will not let me dream
i am sorry but can it wait til tonight i am already late for work 
what is it
not according to his teacher it just got me thinking about jason and what if evangs inherited his father's condition
why what for
unfortunately we have got nothing to work with it is harder playing detective now
but you must have something to go on
if i had to guess i would say the blackouts are stress related
but he is seven what kind of stress can he have
you would be surprised how often they are
well he has been pushing me to meet his father but i have been putting it off
nine ten and you are awake open your eyes dammit
so what did you find
the hemorrhaging the neural damage is irreparable i am frankly surprised he still has use of his motor functions
when did you ever care about getting to school on time
we are putting up pictures for parent's night
thanks do not worry evan you will have plenty of time
um can dad come this time
you know the answer to that
cannot he come out for one day
we have been over this a hundred times it is too dangerous for him
but lenny said that his dad's coming and tommy and kayleigh's dad
i get the point kiddo but i am not so bad am i
my father has a bad memory too
great i will see you soon
honey what were you doing with that
i i do not remember
something must have happened what set him off
i i blacked out
do not try to use your blackouts to get out of this one
what what could he do
i do not know these things take time
how is kayleigh doing she all right
damn it mom i told you i need them all
cute evan
you told me that on parents' weekend remember wait that was not me or you
do not worry i am gonna get you out of here
can you protect me
straight up
because i think he sent me to your cell on purpose for you to help me
shit i knew you were crazy
i ai not bullshitting jesus speaks to me in my dreams
you need to see the prison shrink man
weirder than this
marks scars i dunno anything could happen i guess
signs of the lord they just appeared out of nowhere i thought you were loco
so you believe me
you know my father
not in this wing actually no
i am standing next to kayleigh my hands are over her ears
are you hurting her
no protecting her
i see a car
i cannot the car vanishes and all of a sudden i am on the ground in the woods
are you sure not even with my father
lemme guess would that be where the memories are stored
where are my goddamn books
but i i need those books
you remind me of your father he always screamed for a photo album even though he never had one
i thought you were a december baby
this is bigger seven years to the day no blackouts
that is probably why hannibal lecter's so smart
all i know is that i might be able to unblock some of my repressed memories
shhh i need quiet for this
sorry dude just figured it would be okay with you being sick and all
so let's go this place creeps me out
shit lenny that is happened to you we have gotta get help
you really do not remember anything that happened
damn your dad did this
he is been acting real strange lately he will not even look me in the eyes anymore
duck here they come

of course
when we were kids your dad was making a movie robin hood or something
what do you want to know evan

i thought so where is your husband
at the roulette table trying to win enough for our exit visa well of course he is losing
he tells me he can give us an exit visa but we have no money
does he know that
oh yes
and he is still willing to give you a visa
yes monsieur
and you want to know 
 will he keep his word
he always has
oh yes please
go back to bulgaria
 he is just a lucky guy
thank you but i hardly think 
 then perhaps for the lady the ring is quite unique
berger norwegian and at your service sir
i am sorry it is
yes monsieur
a champagne cocktail please
in a concentration camp one is apt to lose a little weight
we read five times that you were killed in five different places
no thanks carl
monsieur rick
how long can i afford to stay closed
oh two weeks maybe three
maybe i will not have to a bribe has worked before in the meantime everybody stays on salary
oh thank you herr rick sacha will be happy to hear it i owe him money
i will then i am going to the meeting of the 
 do not tell me where you are going
i will not
come up here a minute
i want you to turn out the light in the rear entrance it might attract the police
but sacha always puts out that light 
 tonight he forgot
yes i come i will do it
yes sir
well i will get it from the safe
i am so upset monsieur rick you know i cannot understand 
 forget it emil mistakes like that happen all the time
i am awfully sorry
it shall not happen again monsieur
that is all right
er good luck yes
i would better be going
er my check please
i have to warn you sir i beseech you
it has been a pleasure to meet you
hello ferrari how is business at the blue parrot
fine but i would like to buy your cafe
it is not for sale
you have not heard my offer
it is not for sale at any price
what do you want for sam
i do not buy or sell human beings
suppose we ask sam maybe he would like to make a change
suppose we do
my dear rick when will you realize that in this world today isolationism is no longer a practical policy
no hurry i will have it sent over have a drink with me
you are a fat hypocrite you do not feel any sorrier for ugarte than i do
if i could lay my hands on those letters i could make a fortune
so could i and i am a poor businessman
naturally there will be a few incidental expenses that is the proposition i have for whoever has those letters
i will tell him when he comes in
rick i will put my cards on the table i think you know where those letters are
well you are in good company renault and strasser probably think so too
rick do not be a fool take me into your confidence you need a partner
it is certainly not good enough but since i am in a hurry it will have to do
and abdul and carl and sacha they stay with the place or i do not sell
of course they stay rick's would not be rick's without them
well so long
i shall remember to pay it to myself
those letters were not found on ugarte when they arrested him
not for sure monsieur but i will venture to guess that ugarte left those letters with monsieur rick
good day
you need not be concerned about me
this morning you implied it was not safe for him to leave casablanca
that is also true except for one destination to return to occupied france
occupied france
uh huh under a safe conduct from me
what value is that you may recall what german guarantees have been worth in the past
there are only two other alternatives for him
what are they
it is possible the french authorities will find a reason to put him in the concentration camp here
and the other alternative
my dear mademoiselle perhaps you have already observed that in casablanca human life is cheap good night mademoiselle
how nice you remembered but of course that was the day the germans marched into paris
not an easy day to forget
yes i put that dress away when the germans march out i will wear it again
i will
there's still nobody in the world who can play as time goes by like sam
he has not played it in a long time
we said no questions
here's looking at you kid
in america they would bring only a penny i guess that is about all they are worth
i am willing to be overcharged tell me
and i was wondering
why there is no other man in my life
uh huh
that is easy there was he is dead
i am sorry for asking i forgot we said no questions
well only one answer can take care of all our questions
i am on their blacklist already their roll of honor
it is the gestapo they say they expect to be in paris tomorrow
yeah it is pretty bad timing where were you say ten years ago
ten years ago let's see  yes i was having a brace put on my teeth where were you
looking for a job
ah that is the new german 77 and judging by the sound only about thirtyfive miles away
i know very little about you just the fact that you had your teeth straightened
no no no no we must leave
yes of course we 
 the train for marseilles leaves at five o'clock i will pick you up at your hotel at fourthirty
no no rick not tonight
especially tonight
huh you understand how i feel how long was it we had honey
i did not count the days
has it got a wow finish
i do not know the finish yet
well go on tell it maybe one will come to you as you go along
it does not matter
i do not think i will rick
why not after all i got stuck with a railway ticket i think i am entitled to know
no rick no you see victor laszlo is my husband and was even when i knew you in paris
the stairs from the street
you use richard again we are back in paris
i went through all that with your husband it is no deal
i am not fighting for anything anymore except myself i am the only cause i am interested in
 i would not bring up paris if i were you it is poor salesmanship
please please listen to me if you knew what really happened if you only knew the truth 
i do not have to i have got them right here
put them on the table
now i do not know i know that i will never have the strength to leave you again
and laszlo
i wish i did not love you so much
no not yet
but it is all right is not it you were able to arrange everything
everything is quite all right
oh rick
because you are getting on that plane
i do not understand what about you
i am staying here with him until the plane gets safely away
but what about us
hello miss ilsa i never expected to see you again
yes ma'am a lot of water under the bridge
some of the old songs sam
yes ma'am
i do not know i ai not seen him all night
not tonight no more he ai not coming uh he went home
does he always leave so early
leave him alone miss ilsa you are bad luck to him
play it once sam for old time's sake
i do not know what you mean miss ilsa
play it sam play as time goes by
oh i cannot remember it miss ilsa i am a little rusty on it
will not you join us
victor i am afraid for you
we have been in difficult places before have not we
be careful
i will do not worry
please ilsa do not be hasty
no victor no
and as far away from major strasser as possible
we will discuss it later
victor please do not go to the underground meeting tonight
i must besides it is not often that a man has a chance to display heroics before his wife
he suggested i ask you
ask me
yes he said ask your wife i do not know why he said that
i know how it is to be lonely  is there anything you wish to tell me
no victor there is not
i love you very much my dear
 you do not even have to say it i will believe goodnight dear
of course i will be careful
yes i am ready  goodbye rick god bless you
rick who's he
mademoiselle you are in rick's and rick is 
 is what
oh you have already met rick mademoiselle
 this is mr laszlo
you are saying this only to make me go
how do you do
one hears a great deal about rick in casablanca
and about victor laszlo everywhere
will not you join us for a drink
what for
your work
thank you i try
we all try you succeed
not at all
any time
signor ferrari is the fat gent at the table
good evening you see here we are again
i take that as a great compliment to sam  i suppose he means to you paris of well happier days
go ahead
well is not there some other place it is rather confidential what i have to say
my office
is not it strange that you always happened to be fighting on the side of the underdog
yes i found that a very expensive hobby too but then i never was much of a businessman
i appreciate it but i do not accept it
i will raise it to two hundred thousand
my friend you could make it a million francs or three my answer would still be the same
there must be some reason why you will not let me have them
there is i suggest that you ask your wife
i beg your pardon
i said ask your wife
my wife
thank you
had a close one eh
yes rather
apparently you think of me only as the leader of a cause well i am also a human being
oh save it we have still lots of things to do
keep it you will need it in america
but we made a deal
oh never mind about that you will not have any trouble in lisbon will you
no it is all arranged
good i have got the letters right here all made out in blank
all except one thing there's something you should know before you leave
monsieur blaine i do not ask you to explain anything
here it is
yes what is it you want
very well
no two champagne cocktails please
this is a very interesting cafe i congratulate you
ilsa i do not wish to be the one to say it but it is late
we will be there
i slept very well
that is strange nobody is supposed to sleep well in casablanca
may we proceed with the business
with pleasure will not you sit down
thank you
well perhaps i shall like it in casablanca
i was in a german concentration camp for a year that is honor enough for a lifetime
 thank you
by the way monsieur last night you evinced an interest in signor ugarte
nothing important but may i speak to him now
i should like to discuss some matters arising from your presence on french soil
this is hardly the time or the place
then we shall state another time and another place tomorrow at ten in the prefect's office with mademoiselle
captain renault i am under your authority is it your order that we come to your office
good day
thank you captain it is very good to be here
major strasser my aide lieutenant casselle
by the way the murder of the couriers what has been done
realizing the importance of the case my men are rounding up twice the usual number of suspects
i have already heard about this cafe and also about mr rick himself
good evening captain
champagne and a tin of caviar
may i recommend veuve cliquot '26 a good french wine
thank you
i expected no less captain
how do you do mr rick
well personally major i will take what comes
do you mind if i ask you a few questions unofficially of course
how about new york
you were not always so carefully neutral we have a complete dossier on you
you give him credit for too much cleverness my impression was that he is just another blundering american
but we must not underestimate american blundering i was with them when they blundered into berlin in 1918
it may interest you to know that at this very moment he is on his way here
my dear major we are trying to cooperate with your government but we cannot regulate the feelings of our people
yes much too good a time the place is to be closed
but i have no excuse to close it
find one
victor laszlo is on that plane
ask monsieur rick
how extravagant you are throwing away women like that someday they may be scarce
when it comes to women you are a true democrat
why that is in lisbon
the clipper to america
and what in heavengs name brought you to casablanca
my health i came to casablanca for the waters
waters what waters we are in the desert
i was misinformed
what again
this is no ordinary arrest a murderer no less
i stick my neck out for nobody
a wise foreign policy
yeah have a brandy
victor laszlo
victor laszlo
well he is succeeded in impressing half the world
manages what
his escape
oh but i just told you 
 stop it he escaped from a concentration camp and the nazis have been chasing him all over europe
this is the end of the chase
twenty thousand francs says it is not
i just paid out twenty i would like to get it back
make it ten i am only a poor corrupt official
why two
he is traveling with a lady
he will take one
it does not matter there is no exit visa for him
louis whatever gave you the impression that i might be interested in helping laszlo escape
because my dear ricky i suspect that under that cynical shell you are at heart a sentimentalist
the winning side would have paid you much better
maybe well it seems you are determined to keep laszlo here
i have my orders
oh i see gestapo spank
excuse me
and you already know herr heinze of the third reich
i was born in new york city if that will help you any
 hello ilsa
 thanks i will
serves me right for asking a direct question the subject is closed
well it looks like you are a little late
yeah why
why do you interfere with my little romances
put it down as a gesture to love
i am shocked shocked to find that gambling is going on in here
what friend
then release him you be at my place a half hour before the plane leaves
i will make the arrangements right now with laszlo in the visitor's pen
go ahead ricky
i was informed just as laszlo was about to leave the hotel so i knew i would be on time
i thought i asked you to tie up your watchdogs
oh he will not be followed here
yes i know what you mean but i have already spoken to ferrari you will still win at roulette
is everything ready
tell me when we searched the place where were they
sam's piano
serves me right for not being musical
have you taken leave of your senses
i have sit down over there
put that gun down
i do we have got plenty of time to discuss that later
call off your watchdogs you said
you think of everything do not you
and the names are mr and mrs victor laszlo
stay where you are i do not know what you are talking about
maybe but it seemed like a good time to start
i think perhaps you are right
our expenses
uh huh
louis i think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship
that is so long ago i do not remember
will i see you tonight
i never make plans that far ahead
sacha she is had enough
do not listen to him sacha fill it up
 sacha call a cab
take your hands off me
what is your nationality
i am a drunkard
there seems to be no secret about that
are you one of those people who cannot imagine the germans in their beloved paris
it is not particularly my beloved paris
aha who do you think will win the war
i have not the slightest idea
in this case you have no sympathy for the fox huh
not particularly i understand the point of view of the hound too
good evening mr blaine
i was willing to shoot captain renault and i am willing to shoot you
get me the radio tower
put it down
hello ugarte
oh nothing but when you first came to casablanca i thought 
 you thought what
they got a lucky break yesterday they were just two german clerks today they are the 'honored dead'
you are a very cynical person rick if you will forgive me for saying so
if i gave you any thought i probably would
well rick after tonight i will be through with the whole business and i am leaving finally this casablanca
who did you bribe for your visa renault or yourself
myself i found myself much more reasonable
perhaps an hour perhaps a little longer
i do not want them here overnight
do not be afraid of that please keep them for me thank you i knew i could trust you
do not be a fool you cannot get away
rick hide me do something you must help me rick do something
i like it fine here
he will double what i pay you
yeah but i ai not got time to spend the money i make here
not right now

well i do not think i can remember it
if she can stand it i can play it
yes boss

you do not find it depressing that homer wells is picking apples
dr homer wells

he *smells* like he could put you to sleep
he is a doctor busterdoctors smell like ether
*you are* a doctor homeryou do not smell like ether

why not
what for buster what would you do if you met them

better than i can
sometimes i want to meet them so i can kill them just sometimes

i do not know she got left here like the rest of us did not she
she died of *secrecy* she died of *ignorance*
i will tell them fuzzy was adopted

i do not think mr rose would leave without you
yes but it is closed all the time now because of the blackout
people watched the movies in their cars
when they watched at all do you like movies
yes i have only seen one though
king kong it is really good
i *did* like it all i said was it is not 'king kong'
she *did* love him  how many women have you known
she was torn apart she died of a broken heart
oh sure
well she was in a weakened condition  i do not know what about king kong is that medically possible
you think maybe i was  i love this place
yes and no when you come here you do not really care about the movie
i did not say that growing up in an orphanage you are always lonely you are just never alone
i miss things i miss people  i miss reading to the boys
but you had so much *responsibility*
i never *asked* for any responsibility
just a little privacy
did you come here with wallyto *not* watch movies
ahha  so what is thata radio
the *speaker* for the movie sound
you just cuddle you come to hug to kiss you do not *come* here to watch the movie
that is what *i would* come here for i would watch the movie
not with the right girl you would not
it will be okay
*what* will be okay
we have to wait and see i think that for *everything* in life you have to wait and see
i am just waiting and seeing like you said
i grew up with wally i began my adult life with him
fine that is all there is to it then
no that is not all there is to it i love you tooi *know* i do
okay okayi know you do too
it is a good thing i did not have that baby is not it
well we have to help her
well we cannot force her it is her decision
you do not understand it is her father
mr rose *knows*
he is the *father* he is her baby's father
we have got to keep her away from that bastard
no nothing is nothing i want wally to come home i am afraid to see him too
i know  is *that* nothing
no do notthat is something nothing is nothing  do not even look at me i want
you got up you *did* something if you keep this up you might be in danger of making a *decision*
for god's sake homer wally's been shot down
he is *paralyzed*
he is *alive* he still loves you  so do i
what do you want me to *do*
no that is not iti just want to be sure i understand you
did well okay
please do not
and now that wally's coming back and because he will certainly *need* you
you say that as though it is some awful thing  i never stopped loving wally
she knows how to take care of herself
i am sorry for what i said about wally needing you it was unnecessary
no i am the one who should be sorry you have every right to be angry
no you warned me i did not listen but you warned me
oh he is fine i just heard from him he is bombing all these places
i do not need no more clothes thank you
yes i *have*
i cannot go nowhere
no it ai not muddy muddy's just
well this *is* an orphanage
i never said they were boring
you said apples are not exactly flying
well they are not
well *picking* them is it is about as exciting as walking
i love you too see you tomorrow
i know what you have been doing
he *loved* it  did not you
*homer* liked it  did not you
they wanted a girl
nobody ever wants me
dr larch would not let just anyone take *any* of us
that is true
nobody's asked for me have they
nobody special enough curly
you mean somebody asked
only the right people can have you curly
how old are you dear thirteen
homer was born *here* in what was it 1922
graduated bowdoin college 1935 and harvard school of medicine 1939
well we can only guess about that edna they *are* against the law
but what about school records homer does not have any *diplomas*
he probably does not make much money picking appleshe must have had to pay to send them too
i would not worry edna that he does not have money if he gets hungry he can pick his dinner
edna come dance with me let's be foolish tonight
does he *know* he is supposed to be in india does he even *want* to come back
cirrhosisit is a disease of the liver
*liver* killed him
*alcohol* killed himhe drank himself to death
but did you know him
barely it hardly mattered that i knew him
did you know your mother better
she is dead now too she was a nanny
that is a nanny do
she looks after other people's children
did you grow up around here
no she was an immigrant
that is an immigrant
someone not from maine
